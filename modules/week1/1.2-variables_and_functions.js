/**
 * Variables and Functions, lesson 1.2
 * @author Mike Whitfield
 *
 * Be aware of variables.  You can assign them values.  Some values are numbers.
 * Others are strings.  Go read about the basics while you're at it (see link
 * below #1).  Ignore the stuff about function/variable hoisting for now.  You
 * can wait until module 2 to read about data types.
 *
 * In this module, your goal is to read the code and
 * you will learn that there is a function that answers if the input value,
 * 'guess' matches the summation of variables defined elsewhere.  You should
 * read more about functions (see link #2).
 *
 * You will also learn from this module that each file is a module in Node.
 * Modules can "export" values so other modules can access the exported values.
 * Values are always exported by key names.  You identify key names using the
 * property accessor (see link #3).  You read more about modules if you
 * get bored here, but you should understand we're using Node's module system,
 * for now (see link #4) :)

/*
 Functions sometimes live on objects.  In the following case,
 "console" is an object, and "log" is a *property* on "console".  You call a 
 function by adding open and close parentheses.  Anything in between the 
 parentheses is a parameter.  Parameters are comma separated.
