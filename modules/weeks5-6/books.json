It introduces a variety of techniques, focusing on what students need to know to start adding JavaScript to their Web pages. In each chapter, students perform tasks that focus on a particular technique required for building and creating JavaScript programs. The examples and exercises in this book will help students learn the basics of how to use JavaScript with well-formed Web pages, including how to manipulate the browser object model, validate forms, use object-oriented techniques, and learn how to trace and resolve errors in JavaScript programs, to name a few. Advanced topics include how to manage state information, use the Dynamic Object Model (DOM), create Dynamic HTML (DHTML), update Web pages with AJAX, and create server-side scripts.",

It was not written to distinguish the good features of the JavaScript language from the bad. It is not meant to be a complete reference guide. It is not targeted at people new to programming or those completely new to JavaScript. Nor is this a cookbook of JavaScript recipes. Those books have been written. It was my intention to write a book to give the reader an accurate JavaScript worldview through an examination of native JavaScript objects and supporting nuances: complex values, primitive values, scope, inheritance, the head object, etc. I intend this book to be a short and digestible summary of the ECMA-262, Edition 3 specification, focused on the nature of objects in JavaScript."

    "summary": "JavaScript is a powerful way to extend HTML content and work with Java applets, but developing with this language can be tricky. With this one-volume reference, you can begin using scripts within Web pages and also learn some of JavaScript's high-end features.Early sections treat JavaScript as just another programming language, detailing data types, operators, and basic keywords. Then the book turns to the nuts and bolts of script development inside Web pages, featuring advanced topics you might not find elsewhere, such as the possibility of running JavaScript scripts on the server.Further chapters explain how to get to browser objects from JavaScript, describing windows, forms, and event handling. There is also a good introduction to manipulating Java applets and Netscape plug-ins (such as Shockwave) with JavaScript. But some of the best chapters teach you how to use browser cookies within Java and offer debugging tips from the author. (JavaScript is legendarily difficult to debug, and the author has a number of potentially helpful suggestions here.)Final sections show JavaScript at work with dynamic HTML. The reference material at the end of Instant JavaScript gives a handy listing of JavaScript fundamentals and HTML tags, making this book useful as both a tutorial and a place where JavaScript developers can get answers.",

JavaScript is a prototype-based object-oriented scripting language used to enable programmatic access to computational objects within a host environment. Although also used in other applications, it is primarily used in the form of client-side JavaScript, implemented as part of a web browser, providing enhanced user interfaces and dynamic websites. JavaScript is a dialect of the ECMAScript standard and is characterized as a dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based language with first-class functions. JavaScript was influenced by many languages and was designed to look like Java, but to be easier for non-programmers to work with. JavaScript was originally developed by Brendan Eich of Netscape under the name Mocha, which was later renamed to LiveScript, and finally to JavaScript. The change of name from LiveScript to JavaScript roughly coincided with Netscape adding support for Java technology in its Netscape Navigator web browser. JavaScript was first introduced and deployed in the Netscape browser version 2.0B3 in December 1995. The naming has caused confusion, giving the impression that the language is a spin-off of Java, and it has been characterized by many as a marketing ploy by Netscape...More: http://booksllc.net/?id=9845",

    "summary": "What's the best approach for developing an application with JavaScript? This book helps you answer that question with numerous JavaScript coding patterns and best practices. If you're an experienced developer looking to solve problems related to objects, functions, inheritance, and other language-specific categories, the abstractions and code templates in this guide are ideal -- whether you're writing a client-side, server-side, or desktop application with JavaScript. Written by JavaScript expert Stoyan Stefanov -- Senior Yahoo! Technical and architect of YSlow 2.0, the web page performance optimization tool -- JavaScript Patterns includes practical advice for implementing each pattern discussed, along with several hands-on examples. You'll also learn about anti-patterns: common programming approaches that cause more problems than they solve. Explore useful habits for writing high-quality JavaScript code, such as avoiding globals, using single var declarations, and more Learn why literal notation patterns are simpler alternatives to constructor functions Discover different ways to define a function in JavaScript Create objects that go beyond the basic patterns of using object literals and constructor functions Learn the options available for code reuse and inheritance in JavaScript Study sample JavaScript approaches to common design patterns such as Singleton, Factory, Decorator, and more Examine patterns that apply specifically to the client-side browser environment",

With this book, you�ll discover how to devise excellent tests and real-world testing plans for your existing JavaScript code. Developers starting out on a new project will greatly benefit from these guidelines.Testing a language that runs within many different implementations and environments is inherently difficult�and since most JavaScript environments are UI-based, automated testing becomes even more difficult. This guide shows developers and their managers how to overcome these problems to test JavaScript code efficiently. Topics include:Which types of Javascript testing are most effective When and why should you run tests on Javascript code Code patterns and anti-patterns that promote and inhibit Javascript testing Integrating unit tests with your development and build environments (automated test running and reporting) Code coverage: how to get it, interpret it, and automatically generate it",

    "summary": "Suitable for learning basic programming for Web browsers, Beginning JavaScript is a patient, introductory tutorial on writing scripts successfully. It teaches you how to create client-side scripts (including full coverage of fundamentals like variables and flow control, plus plenty of screen shots.) JavaScript is a good way to learn programming. It's powerful, of course, but the book takes small steps, using scripts that work with string and time data first, and then moving to manipulating browser objects like forms and windows. A running case study for a trivia game helps anchor the steps with a practical (and fun) example. There are plenty of tips on debugging your scripts (including how to use the Microsoft Script Debugger tool), and each section includes sample questions. (The book also offers extensive answers in over 80 pages at the end of the book.) There's plenty of material on the differences between Internet Explorer and Netscape, especially when it comes to Dynamic HTML (DHTML). Coverage of the Document Object Model (DOM) for browsers helps bring the text up to date on some of the latest standards in Web browsers (including the new Netscape 6). While the focus of Beginning JavaScript clearly is on the client, later sections turn to server-side ASP development (in which the sample trivia game is enhanced with ASPs written in JavaScript using ADO and Microsoft Access.) Reference sections on JavaScript and the browser object model for Internet Explorer and Netscape (through version 4.x) round out the material. In all, with its approachable style and clearly rendered code examples, Beginning JavaScript makes for a worthwhile first book of programming for today's browsers. Even if you haven't programmed before, this text can give you the tools you need to bring your static Web pages to life. --Richard Dragan Topics covered: Introduction to JavaScript Cross-browser compatibility issues JavaScript data types and variables Displaying errors Calculations Operators String handling Flow control statements Loops Introduction to using objects The browser object model HTML forms (including types of input controls) Frames and windows Tutorial for regular expressions Advanced string methods Date, time, and timer objects Common errors The Microsoft Script Debugger Cookies Dynamic HTML (DHTML) on Internet Explorer 4.0 and Netscape Navigator 4.x The Document Object Model (DOM) ActiveX controls and plug-ins used with JavaScript Server-scripting Introduction to ASP and databases (including SQL basics and database design with Microsoft Access) Sample case study for a trivia game Sample exercises and answers References to JavaScript Internet Explorer 4 and 5 and Netscape Navigator 4 objects ASP object model reference",

    "summary": "This book makes object-oriented programming accessible and understandable to web developers. It gives great real world examples, which will work for those who only understand enough about HTML and scripting to insert them in their web pages. Plus JavaScript Objects goes on to show how to customize examples for those with greater knowledge of scripting. This enables more experienced readers to go on and build their own tools and demonstrates the powers of JavaScript as an object-oriented programming language, which has far more potential for the development of large scale applications than is currently appreciated.",

It provides everything you need to know about modern JavaScript, and shows what JavaScript can do for your web sites. This book doesn't waste any time looking at things you already know, like basic syntax and structures. Expert web developer and author John Resig concentrates on fundamental, vital topics--what modern JavaScripting is (and isn't), the current state of browser support, and pitfalls to be wary of. The book is organized into four sections: Modern JavaScript development--using JavaScript the object-oriented way, creating reusable code, plus testing and debugging DOM scripting--updating content and styles, plus events, and effect and event libraries Ajax--how Ajax works, overcoming problems, and using libraries to speed up development of Ajax applications The future of JavaScript--looking at cutting edge topics like JSON, HTML 5, and more All concepts are backed up by real-world examples and case studies, and John provides numerous reusable functions and classes to save you time in your development. There are also up-to-date reference appendixes for the DOM, events, browser support (including IE7), and frameworks--so you can look up specific details quickly and easily.",

    "summary": "JavaScript Programmer's Reference documents JavaScript, JScript, and ECMAScript to the degree that they're standardized, and goes on to catalog the extensions major browser publishers have added to the languages. In essence, this book is a resource for finding out how the major browsers (Microsoft Internet Explorer, Netscape Navigator, and Opera) implement their Document Object Models (DOMs), both standard and proprietary, and how they access DOM elements through JavaScript and similar scripting languages. This is a reference, so don't expect it to teach you JavaScript through any sort of tutorial (though reading the object descriptions can be very illuminating, indeed). Cliff Wootton has chosen to organize his work alphabetically, like a giant encyclopedia of objects, reserved words, operators, filters, and other aspects of JavaScript and the DOM standards. A cross-reference that associates individual properties, methods, and event handlers with the objects to which they belong appears as an appendix. Once you've located the entry of the object you want, you'll have easy access to inheritance information, a syntax summary, and plain-English advice on what the object does. Tables provide implementation details for each property, method, and event handler, so you know which versions of which browsers support the language feature you want to use. There also are references to standards documents, and, sometimes, illustrations of how to use the language element in working code. Illustrations are rare but generally effective in clarifying the significance of language elements and the relationships among objects. A cool feature is Wootton's documentation of common errors and incorrect assumptions. For example, he's included an entry on Bar.visibility, a nonexistent property sometimes assumed to exist in the Netscape Navigator object model. The correct property is Bar.visible, the author points out. The book also has some strange ways of doing things: Operators and other non-character entries don't appear up front, before the \"A\" entries, as is conventional. They've been transliterated, if that's the word, so you have to look up \"Add\" in order to find out about the + operator. Overall, this is a fine JavaScript reference, made excellent by its companion CD-ROM that includes the entire body of printed reference material (plus some extra) in searchable form. --David Wall Topics covered: The JavaScript, JScript, and ECMAScript scripting languages, and their implementations in popular browsers as well as in standards documents. Coverage includes JavaScript through version 1.5, JScript through version 5.5, and ECMAScript through version 3. The DOM1 standard is covered fully and the DOM2 standard is covered to the extent it's implemented in Netscape Navigator 6. Effectively, this means coverage includes Netscape Navigator through version 6.0, Internet Explorer through version 5.5, and Opera through version 5. There's also some coverage of server-side JavaScript under Netscape Enterprise Server.",

    "summary": "Ready to expand your PHP web development skills with JavaScript? With this guide, you can use your experience with PHP to learn JavaScript from the ground up. Because both languages share the C language syntax, this book skips similarities such as conditions and loops to focus on JavaScript�s unique object creation, classes, prototypes, and inheritance.PHP is a valuable web development tool on its own, but with the upsurge in client-side development, knowledge of JavaScript has become essential for working with today�s Web. By concentrating on the differences between these languages, this book helps PHP programmers, web architects, and both back-end and front-end engineers become fluent in JavaScript fairly quickly.Learn syntax similarities and differences between JavaScript and PHP Discover how JavaScript behaves with and without the DOM and BOM Work with JavaScript functions�and learn why they�re actually objects Explore JavaScript�s object-oriented features, code reuse, and inheritance Take a close look at JavaScript�s built-in API Learn what�s new in ECMAScript 5, the standard that represents the core JavaScript language Organize your code with JavaScript design patterns Compare JavaScript design patterns with classic programming patterns",

    "summary": "The JavaScript ecosystem can be tough to hack through, even for experienced programmers. There are so many extensive JavaScript reference books and competing libraries to choose from-Prototype, jQuery, MooTools, YUI, Dojo, ExtJS, and so on. Christophe Porteneuve is here to help: he gives you fundamentals, the most handy techniques, and the insider's best practices. If you're reasonably comfortable programming in any widely known language, you'll be able to jump into JavaScript in no time. Divided into six Parts, the book starts with JavaScript code patterns that are too often ignored by JavaScript coders. Part 2 presents several essential JavaScript tasks-DOM and CSS manipulations, plus event handling and timers-in a framework-agnostic way, using syntax from all the major flavors. Parts 3 and 4, respectively, hit JavaScript's best features for user interface functionality-tooltips, lightboxes, image processing, infinite scrolling, and more-and forms for receiving and validating input. Part 5 explores the client/server relationship, touching on cookies, JSON, and Ajax (same- and cross-domain). Part 6 uses JavaScript in mashups with Twitter, Flickr, and geo-related APIs. The appendices feature Christophe's two-page JavaScript cheat sheet, followed by hard-won tips on debugging even the most maddening JavaScript errors. Next is an even-handed assessment of the major frameworks used in the book and in most JavaScript shops today. Last, Christophe presents an extensive group of resources for using and learning JavaScript and the major frameworks. This Pragmatic Guide is strictly focused on the techniques that will get you started in JavaScript. It's where you come to get the full scope of JavaScript in your head--fast! You'll quickly understand its core syntax, capabilities, and related frameworks. Start here first.",

    "summary": "Designing with JavaScript opens up a whole new world to Web-design artists, especially those making the leap from a print-design background. Many people liken Web design to print design, but there is nothing interactive about a printed page. Web pages, however, can be completely dynamic, different from moment to moment and responsive to the reader. The best way to take advantage of this is through JavaScript.Eleven chapters and four appendices cover the basics to the complex, from extracting and validating information using forms to creating rotating images to using DHTML for animation. The first half covers basic yet important issues like an introduction to the syntax of the language, browser detection, setting up forms, and controlling frames and windows. Filled with examples, screen shots, and links to more examples and info, these chapters build a solid foundation for the second half of the book.Dynamic images, rollovers, using cookies, and creating interactive features using DHTML are some of the features covered later in the book, with numerous practical examples. These chapters are invaluable for the learning designer, as nearly every feature is practically required on a contemporary Web site. The appendices include a handy JavaScript guide to the language, including syntax, handlers, an object guide, and style properties.Not everything can be handled (yet) through the available WYSIWYG editors, making this book an invaluable reference and one to keep at your fingertips. --Mike Caputo",

    "summary": "JavaScript is the language of the Web. It has an intuitive, accessible nature and is available with most modern browsers. JavaScript is used for making dynamic, interactive web pages - from form validation to creating games to dynamic menus - but its uses also go much further. Hardly a single commercial web page exists today that does not contain some JavaScript. This second edition of Professional JavaScript provides comprehensive coverage of the JavaScript language, its syntax and uses. We look at the latest web browsers and web standards, and move on to examine practical techniques in the form of short examples and more in-depth and complex case studies. This book will focus entirely on the use of JavaScript within the web browser, since this is predominantly where it is used. This book covers Core JavaScript programming Scripting browser objects Working with multimedia Web standards, including XML, CSS, & W3C DOM Dynamic HTML Debugging techniques Regular expressions and form validation Real world case studies The ECMAScript Edition 4 proposal",

It is about client-side, web focused, and task-oriented JavaScript. JavaScript is a core skill for web professionals, and as every web professional knows, client-side JavaScript can produce all sorts of glitches and bugs. 'Practical JavaScript for the Usable Web' takes a two pronged approach to learning the JavaScript that you need to get your work done: teaching the core client-side JavaScript that you need to incorporate usable interactivity into your web applications, including many short functional scripts, and building up a complete application with shopping cart functionality. When you have finished working with this book, you'll have a thorough grounding in Client-side JavaScript, and be able to construct your own client-side functionality quickly, easily, and without falling into any of the usability traps that this technology leaves wide open. This book covers: DHTML for IE4 and NN4 browsers, and the Dom for the latest browsers Usability techniques Working scripts that can be incorporated into your web applications immediately Step-by-step breakdown of JavaScript shopping cart functionality Advanced Data Validation Techniques",

JavaScript is also widely used for its abilities to manage user input, show text, play sounds, display images, and communicate with a plug-in response. JavaScript, unlike many other programming languages, is relatively easy to master, even for those who have no programming experience. Mastery of JavaScript allows Web masters and Web site developers to easily add interactivity, moving beyond static HTML pages.",

    "summary": "Want to create websites that deliver the fast response times, dynamic user interfaces, and special effects that today's users expect?Then this is the book for you! Whether you're just starting out in JavaScript or whether you're ready to move into DOM scripting, it gives you the skills you need. Here's how:#1: It's 2 books in 1: A JavaScript book and a DOM scripting bookMost books cover JavaScript or DOM scripting. But to create user-responsive sites, you need to know both.So the first half of this book is a course in JavaScript essentials. Then, the second half is a course in DOM scripting that gives you a clear understanding of how DOM scripting works, how JavaScript underlies it, and how to use it to build applications that run slide shows, use drop-down menus, rotate headlines, sort tables, provide animation, and more!That means you can gain basic to expert skills in a single book.#2: It provides a fast startSection 1 is a crash course in JavaScript. In fact, by the end of chapter 3, you'll know how to code, test, and debug applications that include elementary DOM scripting. Then, the rest of the book builds on those skills to cover all the JavaScript and DOM scripting essentials.#3: It shows you how to create and use event-handling libraries for browser compatibilityOne of the headaches of web programming is ensuring that the code will work with all the popular browsers. So this book shows you how to create your own event-handling libraries of browser-compatible code, so you can draw on it as needed. It shows you how to take advantage of free, third-party libraries like jQuery and Dojo. And it helps you to appreciate, and profit from, the extensive libraries of tested code that are included in the downloadable applications for the book. #4: It shows 20 complete applications that can be used as models for new appsThe key to mastering client-side web development is to have plenty of applications that show how the features interact and what problems might occur in building a website. So this book gives you complete code for 20 professional applications. These run the gamut from business applications, like object-oriented forms validation, to entertainment apps, like a rotating, 3-dimensional carousel of images that the user can control with the mouse or keystrokes.You can download these for free from the Murach website. Experiment with them on your own, then use them as time-saving models for new applications.#5: The paired-pages format lets developers set their own paceMurach books have a distinctive format. Each two-page spread presents a single topic: the lefthand page explains the topic, while the righthand page shows the critical details, using syntax, code, screen shots, and how-to notes. Both beginning and experienced developers tell us that this format makes it easy to focus on the information they need, whether they're using the book for training or reference. Again, you can try this out for yourself by downloading chapters 2 and 3 for free from the Murach website.So don't wait to become an expert web developer.

Pro JavaScript Performance gives you the tools you need to keep your sites smooth and responsive no matter how many users you have. Best practices are changing or becoming redefined continually because of changes and optimizations at the interpreter level, and differences in system configuration, and network speeds. This is exacerbated by the quickened release schedule that most browsers have adopted. Just as important as following best practices is the ability to measure your own performance, so that you can adjust as times change, and so that you can note the subtle nuances in your own code and define your own best practices by your own observations. This book gives you the tools to observe and track the performance of your web applications over time from multiple perspectives, so that you are always aware of, and can fix, all aspects of your performance. What you�ll learn Describes the different aspects of performance, and explores the tools for quantifying and improving performance Provides tactical solutions for creating tools to measure the performance of your own web applications Learn to apply performance best practices, and how to quantify your results Who this book is for Pro JavaScript Performance is written for advanced JavaScript users and web developers.

    "summary": "Most Web developers pick up a book to learn how to use a language like JavaScript, looking for practical examples of how to get things done. The Book of JavaScript: A Practical Guide to Interactive Web Pages is plenty practical, and hits the mark as a reader-friendly and well-organized tutorial on JavaScript. The book assumes no prior knowledge in JavaScript or other procedural languages, although familiarity with HTML is best. The well-thought-out text focuses on various programming goals--like rollovers and form validation--instead of the anatomy of the JavaScript language itself. The fast-moving chapters skillfully weave text with example code. Sections of the code and related sections of the accompanying text are numbered--a convention that is very helpful in teaching new techniques, and for quick reference later on. Throughout the book, real-world examples of JavaScript in action, such as a clock script from NASA's site, illustrate its applications. A page from Salon.com, for instance, shows frame techniques, too. Ambitious readers can complete assignments to test their knowledge. The companion CD-ROM contains all of the code, as well as correct answers for the assignments. Of all of the JavaScript tutorials out there, The Book of JavaScript is one of the more engaging and truly effective. --Stephen W. Plain Topics covered: Browser detection Rollovers Window manipulation Custom functions Form processing Arrays Loops Timing events Frames Image maps Form validation Cookies Dynamic HTML (DHTML) Plug-ins ActiveX controls",

    "summary": "This book fills the gap between Drupal 6 modules and theming by showing you how to make use of JavaScript and jQuery to join up server-side modules with your front-end designs. This book is for web designers and developers who want to add JavaScript elements to Drupal themes or modules to create more flexible and responsive user interfaces. You are expected to know about the basic operation of Drupal, and be familiar with the concept of theming and modules in Drupal. No experience of creating themes or modules is required. You will need to know the basics of client-side web development; this means HTML, CSS, but also have a rudimentary grasp of the syntax of JavaScript. Familiarity with PHP programming will be an advantage, since we will be writing PHPTemplate files and (at the end) creating Drupal modules. However, the PHP is covered thoroughly enough that even the PHP neophyte will not find the text too demanding. The book also covers the jQuery JavaScript library and its use in Drupal, but no knowledge of jQuery is expected - you will learn everything you need in this book.",

    "summary": "This book covers the entire process of building a website. This process involves much more than just technical knowledge, and this book provides you with all the information you'll need to understand the concepts behind designing and developing for the Web, as well as the best means to deliver professional, best-practice-based results. There is far more to building a successful website than knowing a little Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). The process starts long before any coding takes place, and this book introduces you to the agile development process, explaining why this method makes so much sense for web projects and how best to implement it. Planning is vital, so you'll also learn how to use techniques such as brainstorming, wireframes, mockups, and prototypes to get your project off to the best possible start and help ensure smooth progress as it develops. An understanding of correct, semantic markup is essential to any web professional, so this book explains how XHTML should be used to structure content so that the markup adheres to current web standards. You'll learn about the wide range of HTML elements available to you, and you'll learn how and when to use them through building example web pages. Without creative use of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), websites would all look largely the same. CSS gives you the ability to set your website apart from the rest while maintaining the integrity of your markup. You'll learn how CSS works and how to apply styles to your pages, enabling you to realize your design ideas in the browser. JavaScript can be used to make your website easier and more interesting to use. This book provides information on appropriate uses of this technology and introduces the concepts of programming using it. You'll also see how JavaScript works as part of the much-hyped technique Ajax and in turn where Ajax fits into the wider Web 2.0 picture. While a website is being built, it needs to be tested across multiple browsers and platforms to ensure that the site works for all users, regardless of ability or disability, and the book explains how best to do these tasks. Then, it discusses the process of launching and maintaining the site so that it will continue to work for all its users throughout its life-cycle. The book concludes by covering server-side technologies, acting as a guide to the different options available and explaining differences between available products. With insights from renowned experts such as Jason Fried of 37signals, Daniel Burka of Digg and Pownce, and Chris Messina of Citizen Agency, Foundation Website Creation provides invaluable information applicable to every web project, regardless of size, scope, or budget. In this book you'll See how the Web has developed and the role web standards play Learn how to plan and manage the building of a website Learn how to separate content from presentation with HTML and CSS See how JavaScript can be used to enhance your website Learn how best to test, launch, and maintain a website Summary of Contents Chapter 1 Introducing the Past, Present, and Future of the Web Chapter 2 Keeping a Project on Track Chapter 3 Planning and High-Level Design Chapter 4 Writing Markup with HTML and XHTML Chapter 5 Exploring Fundamental Concepts of CSS Chapter 6 Developing CSS in Practice: From Design to Deployment Chapter 7 Creating Interactivity with JavaScript Chapter 8 Testing, Launching, and Maintaining Chapter 9 Web 2.0: Using Ajax and Social Software Chapter 10 Using Server-Side Technologies Afterword The Business of the Web",

It presents ten complete example projects for you to learn from and adapt for use in your own work. The book starts with a quick recap of the fundamentals of modern JavaScript development before moving right along to the applications. For each application, you are taken through the planning, design, and implementation stages. There's something for everyone here--a utility library, a validation framework, a GUI widget framework, a dynamic event calendar application, a drag-and-drop shopping cart, and more! Over the course of the book, author Frank Zammetti covers JavaScript best practices, Ajax techniques, and some of the most popular JavaScript libraries, such as Prototype, Script.aculo.us, and the Yahoo YUI. One of the main premises of this book is to help you learn by example so you can then apply your knowledge to your own projects. This book will save you countless hours of development time and help further your JavaScript knowledge!",

    "summary": "The JavaScript language is widely used for simple online applications. This useful book presents HTML and JavaScript in a way that uniquely meets the needs of students in the sciences and engineering. It explains how to create simple, client-side applications for scientific and engineering calculations. It includes many complete HTML/JavaScript examples with science/engineering applications to guide the reader progressively and comprehensively through the subject. This book is specifically targeted at a technical audience-- but not one that is necessarily familiar with a programming language-- and gives the reader a sufficient understanding of HTML and JavaScript to write their own online applications. The exposition emphasises basic programming principles in a modern Web-oriented environment, making it also highly suitable for an introductory programming course for non-computer-science majors. Features and topics: � Includes detailed code examples and output to guide the reader � Is extremely accessible, and ideal for self-study � Offers a working knowledge of HTML and JavaScript, which are essential for Web development and useful as a marketable skill � Written specifically to meet the needs of science and engineering students and working professionals � Provides an author-supported supplementary website containing code examples and all graphics files: www.pages.drexel.edu/~brooksdr/DRB_web_page/BookCode/BookCode.htm. Introduction to HTML and JavaScript for Scientists and Engineers addresses directly the needs of engineers and scientists by explaining just those components of HTML and JavaScript needed to write their own online applications. The book will prove an indispensable introduction and guide for professionals, as well for students interested in learning about these useful tools. Dr Brooks has authored the successful Springer titles, Problem solving with Fortran 90 for Scientists and Engineers, and C Programming: The Essentials for Engineers and Scientists.",

It is a powerful scripting language that lets web developers produce more powerful, more user-friendly and more interactive web pages, and with the release of the Version 5 browsers its power will become even greater. JavaScript is not just for client-side, however; it's increasingly finding favour as a server side programming language- in Microsoft's ASP technology- and as a programming language for administration tasks with applications such as the Windows Scripting Host. This book covers the broad spectrum of programming JavaScript - from the core language to browser applications and server-side use to stand-alone and embedded JavaScript. It includes a guide to the language - when where and how to get the most out of JavaScript - together with practical case studies demonstrating JavaScript in action. Coverage is bang up-to-date, with discussion of compatability issues and version differences, and the book concludes with a comprehensive reference section.",

Moon Node Astrology combines depth psychology, astrology and reincarnation to bring a new focus on the shadow personality and the evolutionary process of the individual. Explains the scientific background and the psychological approach used with the nodes and the moon node chart. Also covers the relationship with esotericism and the ideas of Alice Bailey, explaining how earlier lives are shown in the aspect structure and house positions of planets in the nodal chart. Examples are given of working with the 'three charts' - nodal, natal and house - in helping to understand where the client has come from, where they are now, and where they are going.

You�ll learn how easy it is to adopt the \"Zen of AngularJS.\"With AngularJS, you�ll learn how to:Separate responsibilities with MVC for maximum flexibility Use declarative programming for the user interface, and imperative programming for business logic Eliminate the marshalling boilerplate in data binding to make MVC effortless Extend HTML syntax Use dependency injection for refactoring, testability, and designing apps for multiple environments Gain structural support for switching views and deep linking",

Each pair of planets (any two) orbital planes intersect to create sensitive points, more like power points for that matter. As the planets travel around their orbits through time, they reach these power points or nodes two times in a complete orbit or cycle. At that point, the planet is not only in the plane of its own orbit, but simultaneously in the plane of the second planet, and this is a point of power or emphasis. This book is about the system of planetary nodes, a system of inclinations/disinclinations, and how to interpret them in your own natal chart. The book not only covers the theory and history of this technique, but also includes 160 230 Astro*Image cards and written text that interprets each planet in the plane of every other planet, both at the Interface Points and the Square Points.",

    "summary": "The Frozen Section Library series provides concise, user-friendly, site specific handbooks that are well illustrated and highlight the pitfalls, artifacts and differential diagnosis issues that arise in the hurried frozen section scenario. Frozen Section Library: Lymph Nodes highlights the usefulness of techniques such as touch preparation cytology and fine needle aspiration (FNA) cytology, as well as FNA biopsy. This fascicle also suggests proper handling for subsequent ancillary studies, including flow cytometric, cytogenetic, and molecular studies. Special emphasis is given to the limitations of frozen section diagnosis in lymph node pathology. All chapters are written by experts in their fields and include the most up to date scientific information. This book serves as a very useful resource for physicians in the frozen section room and in intra-operative consultation situations dealing with, and interested in, this very complex field of diagnostic pathology. Frozen Section Library: Lymph Nodes is of great value to pathologists, residents, and fellows who diagnose pathologic processes involving lymph nodes. Cherie H. Dunphy, M.D. is Professor of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Executive Director of Hematopathology and Hematopathology Fellowship Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine University of North Carolina Chapel Hill, NC.",

    "summary": "Welcome to the future. The 21st century has come of age and it seems that everything that could have gone wrong has gone wrong. Propelled beyond the brink by environmental catastrophe, by cultural degeneration and the foretold collapse of the monetary system, the American landscape has given way to a postmodern picaresque. In such a world, where crime has been normalized, sex has been mechanized, and where ethnic enclaves equipped with inscrutable bio-engineered surveillance gadgetry vie for the last remnants of power, one hapless pilgrim stands athwart the apocalyptic tide. Emboldened by dim nostalgia and quixotic resolve, this man -- our hero, as we may insist -- will marshal a fractious retinue of co-ethnic subversives (the maligned Cauks ) to establish a stronghold, a redoubt, a community ... a Node. It remains only to be seen whether the seeds of renewal might yet find purchase, or be left to ash.",

Fortunes on the front swing as each side brought new and more powerful hardware into play. With the German development of the Panther and Tiger tanks, it looked as though the Axis forces had developed tanks capable of destroying anything that the Red Army possessed and, in order to counter this threat, STAVKA, the General Headquarters for the Soviet Armed Forces during the war, realized that a new tanks, capable of carrying a large caliber gun, was essential. Selecting the 122mm gun, already in use as an artillery piece, meant that the turret and hull of the existing 'KV' tank had to be redesigned. The result was the 'JS' series, of which some 2000 -1 and -2 models were constructed before the end of the war.The radically different JS-3, with its inverted saucer turret, was developed towards the end of the war but was only introduced in time to be used as a propaganda piece at the Berlin Victory Parade in September 1945. The latter was, however, to form the basis of Soviet heavy amour for the next decade and see active service in Hungary during the 1956 uprising and, on the Arab side, during the Six Day War of 1967.",

Whenever anything goes wrong in one's life, the person wants to revert to the South Node position where he is safe and secure. The Nodes signify the relationship between the plane of the Moon's orbit and that of Earth's orbit. Earth's orbit centers around the Sun, as do the other planets, but the Moon's orbit goes around the Earth. It is the meeting of these two planes that produces the Nodes. This relationship between the two orbits becomes the relation of Earth to Sun. This means an adjustment of our Earth-centered ego and our own self-will with that of the solar self, or cosmic will.",

Node means that JavaScript is no longer just for browsers. It's for web application development, it's for developing any internet protocol, it's for the real-time web, it's for command line scripts, and much more. Node Web Development gives you an excellent starting point straight into the heart of developing server side web applications with node. You will learn, through practical examples, how to use the HTTP Server and Client objects, the Connect and Express application frameworks, the algorithms for asynchronous execution, and use both SQL and MongoDB databases. This book is the ideal companion for getting started with Node. Starting with practical advice on installing Node for both development and application deployment, you will learn how to develop both HTTP Server and Client applications. Many different ways of working with Node are shown, including using database storage engines in applications and developing websites both with and without the Connect/Express web application framework. You will also get an introduction to Node's CommonJS module system allowing you to implement an important subset of object-oriented design. What you will learn from this book Discover the role of server-side JavaScript in web application development Make informed architecture choices in Node for performance and throughput Install and use Node for both the development and deployment of server-side web applications Use the Connect and Express application frameworks Set up either SQL or MongoDB database systems in your application Learn the difference between synchronous and asynchronous algorithms and why they are important Approach This book is a practical introduction to learning about Node. Each chapter introduces you to a different area of Node, using screenshots and examples to get you up and running as quickly as possible. Who this book is written for If you are a developer who wants to use JavaScript on the server side in order to build quicker, higher performing web applications, then this book is for you. It is recommended that you should have at least a rudimentary understanding of JavaScript and web application development.",

    "summary": "This book is the first comprehensive guide to the Moon's nodes--probably the most misunderstood points in astrology. The nodes are not planets, but the points on your birth chart where the orbit of the Moon around the Earth crosses the ecliptic. The nodes are the key to understanding your spiritual purpose for this lifetime. The South Node reveals the lessons, talents, and abilities you mastered in past lives, while the North Node shows you how to best use your past-life skills for spiritual growth, happiness, and success in this life. The Complete Node Book presents a new and empowering perspective on the nodes. It defines and analyzes the specific lessons and challenges presented by each of the 144 possible placements of the nodes. Both sign and house placement of the nodes are considered for extraordinarily insightful and accurate interpretations. For beginning astrologers, this guidebook provides easy-to-find personal interpretations and a free birth chart offer. For advanced astrologers, it will serve as the definitive reference manual on the Moon's nodes.",

In this new edition of C.J.�s Fate, Hooper delivers a funny, sexy, heartfelt story about breaking free, taking chances�and finding the last thing you�re looking for.Librarian C. J. Adams thinks marriage is a fine tradition�for somebody else. The love of her life is history, and in her experience, few men compare with the daring heroes who shaped civilization. Well-traveled, well-educated, and content to stay single, C.J. is convinced she isn�t missing anything. But her close friends disagree. When they resolve to find her soul mate during a trip to Aspen, C.J. stays a step ahead of them by enlisting a gorgeous stranger to pose as her lover. But the man proves to be far more charismatic�and convincing�than she expected, and C.J. soon discovers a side of herself she didn�t know existed. She never imagined that the Rockies had more in store for her than a skiing trip with friends, but whether she likes it or not, C.J.�s fate is about to be sealed.",

The story of your evolving soul�through the past, present, and future�can be read in your lunar nodes. No other book on the market offers such in-depth information on the lunar nodes-the points where the moon's orbit crosses the sun's path. Natioally-renowned astrologer Celeste Teal explores numerous ways to interpret the north and south nodes�in relation to houses, ruling planets, aspects, signs, the Part of Fortune, the Vertex, and more�in the natal chart. As your karmic path is revealed, you'll learn which personality traits to leave behind, where spiritual growth is needed, and where opportunity for rewards may be found. This comprehensive guide will also help you gain insights into relationships, make predictions, and understand how fate may be impacting your life.",

    "summary": "A specialized variation on the artificial neural node is proposed that can accept unprocessed image data at its inputs. The intended use of the neural node variation, called an Image Node, is to efficiently replace a large number of conventional neural nodes at the lowest level of artificial neural networks used in image recognition devices. Prior applications of artificial neural networks have required special preprocessing and the transformation of image data before the data could be presented to the network. The Image Node incorporates conventional image processing algorithms that permit it to accept unprocessed color image data and to make comparisons with a stored exemplar.\n\nThe Image Node based network bears some resemblance to a Counter-Propagation Network, which consists of a lower layer of LVQ neurons and an upper layer of Outstar neurons. The Images Nodes have a role that is similar to the LVQ neurons---learning a set of codes, or in this case, image fragments, which can encode the target image set. In place of the Outstar layer of a Counter-Propagation Network, a network based upon Image Nodes will use one or more upper layers of back-propagation nodes.\n\nThe image Node has internal mechanisms to deal with problems of color comparison and background versus foreground image information. It's design also emphasizes the importance of localized areas of image match. These heuristic functions give each Image Node the power to replace a very large number of conventional neural nodes. The Image Node is proposed as a potentially useful tool to be applied to image recognition tasks. The Image Node algorithm is described and demonstrations of its capabilities are presented.",

It will address the topic of fine needle aspiration of lymph nodes and fulfill the need for an easy-to-use and authoritative synopsis of lymph node cytopathology. The book with adopt an algorithmic diagnostic approach, starting from the cytomorphologic pattern of the lymph node aspirate. The focus will be on the appropriate and effective use of ancillary studies (immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, fluorescence in situ hybridization and molecular techniques) and integration of their results into the final diagnosis. The book will present the cytopathologic features and differential diagnoses for the major cytologic patterns in lymph node fine needle aspiration. The entities typically falling within each of these patterns will be discussed with illustration of the spectrum of cytologic features, differential diagnoses and pitfalls. The book will cover the full spectrum of benign and malignant primary conditions of the lymph nodes, with emphasis on common disorders. Discussion of metastatic conditions will be restricted to those that are relevant to the differential diagnosis of primary lymphoid disorders. This book is designed as an easy to use resource that fits into the lab coat pocket, ideal for portability and quick reference. It is heavily illustrated and contains useful algorithms that guide the reader through the differential diagnosis of common and uncommon entities encountered in lymph node aspirates. The accompanying text follows an easy to use pattern-based outline. A useful resource for every pathologist, cytopathologist, fellow and trainee.",

    "summary": "While a pattern approach to diagnosis is taught and practiced with almost every other tissue or organ in the body, the lymph node remains a mystery to most residents starting out in pathology and those pathologists with limited experience in the area. A Pattern Approach to Lymph Node Diagnosis demonstrates that a systematic approach to lymph node examination can be achieved through recognition of morphological patterns produced by different disease processes. It presents a combination of knowledge-based assessment and pattern recognition for diagnosis covering the major primary neoplastic and non neoplastic diseases and metastatic tumors in lymph nodes. This volume demonstrates that lymph node compartments can be recognized histologically especially with the aid of immunohistological markers and how this knowledge can be employed effectively to localize and identify pathological changes in the different compartments in order to facilitate histological diagnosis. It also defines histological features that, because of their pathological occurrence in lymph nodes, are useful pointers to specific diagnoses or disease processes. The volume is organized in accordance with the primary pattern of presentation of each diagnostic entity. Differential diagnosis is discussed and each diagnostic entity is accompanied by color illustrations that highlight the diagnostic features. Immunohistochemistry, clinical aspects, relevant cytogenetics and molecular information of each entity is provided by authors who are experts in lymphoproliferative diseases. An algorithmic approach to diagnosis is adopted at the end of each section by listing a set of questions that help to consider diagnostic entities that can present with the morphological features observed. A Pattern Approach to Lymph Node Diagnosis will be of great utility to residents and fellows in pathology and general pathologists making first hand lymph node diagnoses as well as to hematologists and physicians who treat patients with lymphoprolifeative diseases.",

    "summary": "Active networks aim to provide a software framework that enables network applications to customize the processing of their communication packets. Security is of critical importance to the success of active networking. This thesis presents a design and a description of the implementation for securing the node of an active network using active networking principles. The secure node architecture includes an active node operating system security API, an active security guardian, and quality of protection (QoP) provisions. The architecture supports highly customized and situational policies created by users and applications dynamically. It permits active nodes to satisfy the application-specific dynamic security and protection requirements. The secure node architecture can provide a fundamental base for securing the active network infrastructure.\n\nIn addition to the secure node architecture, this thesis also presents the analysis of secure information flow using a type system. Information flow control is concerned with the right of dissemination of information. Secure information flow properly restricts the propagation of sensitive cryptographic data beyond the security API to untrusted environments. The analysis demonstrates that the type system can ensure secure flow enforcement efficiently and therefore provide additional security assurance for active networks.\n\nWe describe the integration of secure node architecture into two active network software systems to demonstrate its flexible and innovative features and to present detailed performance results.",

In this book, Aspiration Cytology of the Lymph Node, the text has been written in a very simplified and understandable manner, along with the corresponding photomicrographs provided for better understanding. The distinction between floridly reactive process and the beginning of atypical changes is usually very subtle. This book focuses in detail, beginning from the entire range of reactive, to infectious pathology, to the malignancies pertaining per se to the lymph node and those that are metastatic to it. It will greatly help the postgraduate residents as well as the consultants working in the discipline of pathology. All the photomicrographs are originally taken and specific focus has been made on the cells that cause diagnostic problems.",

    "summary": "J. S. BACH by ALBERT SCHWEITZER. TRANSLATORS FOREWORD: Within the last few years Bach research has made a notable advance. Among the books that have contributed to this progress, that of Dr, Albert Schweitzer takes a leading place. It is equally valuable on the xsthetic and the practical sides its convincing demonstration of the pictorial bent of Bachs mind must necessarily lead to a reconsideration not only of the older view of Bach as a mainly abstract musician, but of the aesthetics of music in general while the chapters on the right manner of per forming Bachs works throw many a new light on this obscure subject. Most of all are correct ideas on this latter point invaluable now, when Bach is beginning, as one hopes, to win his due popularity among not only musicians but music lovers as a whole, The present translation has been made from the German version of Dr, Schweitzers book 1908, which is itself a greatly expanded version of a French original published in 1905, The text, however, has been largely altered and added to at Dr. Schweitzers request. The English edition is thus fuller and more correct even than the German. Like most other translators I have found it convenient - and indeed necessary to preserve the word clavier to cover all the seventeenth and eighteenth century instru ments the harpsichord, clavichord, clavicembalo, c of the type now represented by the pianoforte. For the benefit of the English reader I have given all the references to Spittas Life of Bach in the correspond ing pages of the English edition of that book, published by Messrs. Novello Co. The index to the German original of Dr. Schweitzers book being hardly adequate, I have prepared a fuller one of my own, which I hope will increase the usefulness of the volumes. ERNEST NEWMAN. PREFACE TO THE GERMAN EDITION: In the autumn of 1893 a young Alsatian presented himself to me and asked if he could play something on the organ to me, Play what I asked. Bach, of course, was his reply. In the following years he returned regularly for longer or shorter periods, in order to habilitate himself as they used to say in Bachs day in organ playing - under my guidance, One day in 1899, when we were going through the chorale preludes, I confessed to him that a good deal in these compositions was enigmatic to me, Bachs musical logic in the preludes and fugues, I said, is quite simple and clear but it becomes cloudy as soon as he takes up a chorale melody. Why these sometimes almost excessively abrupt antitheses of feeling Why does he add contrapuntal motives to a chorale melody that have often no relation to the mood of the melody Why all these incomprehen sible things in the plan and the working-out of these fan tasias The more I study them the less I understand them . Naturally, said my pupil, many things in the chorales must seem obscure to you, for the reason that they are only explicable by the texts pertaining to them. I showed him the movements that had ptmlecl me the most he translated the poems into French for me iroiu memory. The mysteries were all solved. During the next few afternoons we played through the whole of the chorale preludes. While Schweitzer for he was the pupil explained them to me one after the other, 1 made the acquaintance of a Bach of whose existence I had previously had only the dimmest suspicion, In a flash it became clear to me that the cantor, of St. Thomass was much more than an incomparable contrapuntist to whom I had formerly looked up as one gazes up at a colossal statue, and that his work exhibits an unparalleled desire, and capacity for expressing poetic ideas and for bringing word and tone into unity.

Bachs Clavierbuchlein vor Wilhelm Friedemann Bach 1770. Introduction ORNAMENTATION writes Paul Henry Lang In his monumental study of music in western civilization, is the most typical feature of baroque style, equally prominent in all phases of baroque art. 1 Musical ornamentation is no exception. It is now generally recognized that the ornaments form an integral part of the mu sical language of Bachs time, and that a performance of his works in which the trills, turns, appoggiaturas, and mordents are omitted or interpreted incorrectly, does violence to the musical ideas he intended to express. Organists who are conscientious mu sicians and devoted to Bachs works doubtless feel a sincere desire to cany out the composers intentions. But they are often per plexed as to just how to proceed in order to do so, being handi capped at the start by a lack of reliable guides. Modern editions of Bachs works conflict with each other in regard to the signs and placing of the ornaments as well as in their directions for executing them. Efforts to solve the problem by consulting the works of scholars such as Pirro, Schweitzer, and Dannreuther only lead to further confusion the experts disagree among themselves. There are two reasons for these discrepancies and for the un reliability of editors and commentators 1 these scholars base their interpretations upon documents that were written too late i Music in Western Civilization New York W. W. Norton Co., 1941 , p. 359. 1 2 ORNAMENTATION IN J. S. BACHS ORGAN WORKS to be trustworthy guides to Bachs practice 2 they undertake their quest for authenticity along the lines of 19th-century re search, which are not applicable to the Baroque period. Both Pirro 2 and Schweitzer 3 are guilty of lapses in scholar ship when they base their discussions of Bachs ornaments upon directions given by Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach, Quantz, and Turk in treatises that were not published until after Bachs death. Dannreuthers treatment of Bachs ornamentation is marred by similar inconsistencies after dealing competently with 17th-century ornamentation as exemplified in the works of Bachs forerunners, he proceeds, in the case of Bach himself, to adduce numerous exceptions to the common practice of the period exceptions, needless to say, that Bach had never heard of and to introduce, arbitrarily, new ornaments such as the so-called Tralltriller, whose invention actually dates from the following genera tion. 4 Caspar Koch, the most recent contributor to the literature of this subject, falls into the same error that his predecessors did, by citing, in support of his directions, realizations of orna ments extracted from treatises by Marpurg 1750, Quantz 1752, C. P. E. Bach 1753, Leopold Mozart 1756, Dom Bedos de Celles 1778, Rellstab 1789, and Turk 1789. 5 Now it so happens that the last half of the 18th century is pre cisely the period of the most rapid changes in both the composi tion and performance of music changes which brought about the disintegration of the Baroque ideals and the formation of the Classic style of Mozart, Haydn, and Beethoven...",

    "summary": "In January 1962, still in his early twenties, photographer David Bailey fulfilled a dream that dated back to his years in Singapore, when he served in the Royal Air Force. Heading to the U.S., home to the jazz music he so admired, Bailey made his first foreign trip for Vogue, accompanied by his model and girlfriend, Jean Shrimpton. The impact of the couple's early collaborations set new standards that helped put Britain back on the world map of popular culture--though at the time, his aesthetic was so controversial that, as a representative of the magazine, Vogue asked him not to wear his leather jacket in the St. Regis Hotel. (Of course he ignored the advice.) The groundbreaking series that Bailey produced with his recently acquired 35mm camera was special. Newly freed from the confines of the studio, he shot rapidly on the streets and recorded the pioneer moment just before meeting Andy Warhol, and a year before his friends the Rolling Stones launched their own transatlantic invasion. Bailey's historic visual breakthrough is manifested in the energy of these images, even as they convey a certain innocence--the photographs of these \"absolute beginners\" have a charm and freshness that still resonate today.",

    "summary": "This book introduces you to Node, the new web development framework written in JavaScript. You'll learn hands-on how Node makes life easier for experienced JavaScript developers: not only can you work on the front end and back end in the same language, you'll also have more flexibility in choosing how to divide application logic between client and server. Written by a core contributor to the framework, Node: Up and Running shows you how Node scales up to support large numbers of simultaneous connections across multiple servers, and scales down to let you create quick one-off applications with minimal infrastructure. Built on the V8 JavaScript engine that runs Google Chrome, Node is already winning the hearts and minds of many companies, including Google and Yahoo! This book shows you why. Understand Node's event-loop architecture, non-blocking I/O, and event-driven programming Discover how Node supports a variety of database and data storage tools Learn best practices for writing easy-to-maintain code for Node Get concrete examples of how to use the various Node APIs in practice Take advantage of the book�s complete API reference",

Excerpt: Cardiac muscle is a type of involuntary striated muscle found in the walls and histologic foundation of the heart, specifically the myocardium. Cardiac muscle is one of three major types of muscle, the others being skeletal and smooth muscle. The cells that comprise cardiac muscle are called cardiomyocytes and are sometimes seen as an intermediate between other types of muscle in terms of appearance, structure, metabolism, excitation-coupling and mechanism of contraction. Cardiac muscle shares similarities with skeletal muscle with regard to its striated appearance and contraction, with both differing significantly from smooth muscle cells. In addition, cardiac muscle cells, like skeletal muscle cells, are multinuclear whereas smooth muscle cells are mononuclear. Coordinated contraction of cardiac muscle cells in the heart propel blood forward from the atria and ventricles to the blood vessels of the circulatory system. Cardiac muscle cells, like all tissues in the body, rely on an ample blood supply to deliver oxygen and nutrients and to remove waste products such as carbon dioxide.

It has been reproduced in the best form available to the Pentagon. It is not spiral-bound, but rather assembled with Velobinding in a soft, white linen cover. The Storming Media report number is A849553. The abstract provided by the Pentagon follows: Maritime data communications are expensive and of limited capacity. Currently there is no established infrastructure to support Internet connectivity for sea-going vessels. The SeaNet program is investigating maritime networking solutions. One aspect of the SeaNet program is promoting remote network management. Remote network management will provide the maritime research community with a flexible and cost-effective tool for monitoring sea based assets. The objective of this thesis is to investigate remote network management over a satellite connection in support of the SeaNet programs goals. To research the potential for remote network management, the Naval Postgraduate School has developed its own SeaNet laboratory. This laboratory simulates both the shipboard and shore-based infrastructure of the SeaNet program and conducts remote network management on these components. This thesis discusses the SeaNet program, network management concepts, the NPS SeaNet laboratory, research findings and recommendations for fliture research. Remote Network Management of the SeaNet Control Node system is possible, however, continued research in this area is needed.",

In der Tat verweist der Begriff des Handlungsspielraumes auf das Subjekt und seine Möglichkeiten, innerhalb eines sozialen Raumes zu agieren. Bezogen auf NS-Täter, Mitwisser und ��\"läufer, Schreibtischtäter und so weiter rekurriert der Begriff, auf das Potential „Was wäre möglich gewesen, wenn sich eine Person anders verhalten hätte.“ Gleichzeitig dient er aber auch als Folie, vor dem die zahlreiche Mittäterschaft breiter Bevölkerungsschichten gespiegelt wird, die Schuld nicht mehr nur auf die zwangspathologisierten Eliten des NS-Systems transferiert, sondern die Mitschuld großer Teile der Bevölkerung geschärft wird.3 Im Zusammenhang der neueren Täterforschung hat sich auch unser Wissen über die nationalsozialistischen Konzentrationslager in den vergangenen 15 bis 20 Jahren systematisch erweitert, eine ganze Reihe von Publikationen geben Aufschluss über Planung4, Errichtung, Funktionsweise und Zweck von Konzentrationslagern im Herrschaftsgefüge der Nationalsozialisten.5 Auch die KZ-Gedenkstätten publizieren auf lokaler Ebene, so dass zumindest die deutschen Gedenkstätten nicht nur Eingang in die Forschungslandschaft finden, sonder diese auch zum großen Teil prägen.",

Bach - A Listener's Guide to His Choral Music introduces the general listener to a genre of music that is mistakenly supposed to be \"difficult.\" A vivid biographical sketch of Bach's life and times provides the necessary background. The book then takes on the question \"What is a cantata?\" and guides the listener systematically through fugue, recitative, and aria. The author chooses 30 of Bach's 200 church cantatas that are especially likely to be performed live, and explores them in detail. Studies of the two great oratorios, the \"St John Passion\" and the \"St. Matthew Passion,\" follow, together with a detailed analysis of what Bach himself probably thought to be his finest work, the \"Mass in B Minor.\" The book is accompanied by a 75-minute CD featuring complete tracks from five of the finest cantatas, as well as several tracks from the two Passions, the Mass, and \"Magnifcat.\"",

    "summary": "The Boundary Node Method (BNM) and the Hypersingular Boundary Node Method (HBNM) are developed in this work for solving problems in potential theory and linear elasticity. The BNM and HBNM represent a coupling between Boundary Integral Equations (BIEs) and Moving Least Squares (MLS) interpolants. The main idea here is to retain the dimensionality advantage of the former and the meshless attribute of the later. This results in decoupling of the mesh and the interpolation procedure for the field variables.\n\nA general purpose BNM and HBNM computer code (serial and parallel), for 3D problems in potential theory and linear elasticity, has been developed. Several parameters involved in the meshless method need to be chosen carefully for the successful implementation of the method. An in-depth and systematic study has been carried out in order to better understand the effects of the various parameters on the performance of the proposed meshless method. Since the proposed meshless method is quite computer intensive, a parallel version of the serial code is developed in this work.\n\nThe hypersingular residuals, developed for error estimation in the mesh-based collocation Boundary Element Method (BEM), are extended to the meshless BNM setting. A simple a posteriori error estimation and an effective adaptive refinement procedure are presented. The implementation of all techniques involved in this work are discussed and several numerical examples for adaptive analysis are given and discussed in detail.",

Composed around 1720, the sonatas and partitas display rich polyphonic writing, unlike the simpler monophonic cello suites. This collection features a challenging but rewarding transcription of the complete A minor Violin Sonata, which fits particularly well on the bass. Also included are the well-known gavotte en rondeau from the E major violin partita and the complete A minor partita for solo flute, transposed here to D minor. Finally, an arrangement of the familiar chorale Jesu, Joy of Man'Board, a group of nationally prominent doctors dedicated to dispelling the myth that milk is natureBoard, a group of nationally prominent doctors dedicated to dispelling the myth that milk is natureBoard, a group of nationally prominent doctors dedicated to dispelling the myth that milk is natures Desiring takes advantage of the bass's natural and artificial harmonics.

However, the most prevalent applications of queueing theory are in the telecommunications field. Queueing Theory for Telecommunications: Discrete Time Modelling of a Single Node System focuses on discrete time modeling and illustrates that most queueing systems encountered in real life can be set up as a Markov chain. This feature is very unique because the models are set in such a way that matrix-analytic methods are used to analyze them. Queueing Theory for Telecommunications: Discrete Time Modelling of a Single Node System is the most relevant book available on queueing models designed for applications to telecommunications. This book presents clear concise theories behind how to model and analyze key single node queues in discrete time using special tools that were presented in the second chapter. The text also delves into the types of single node queues that are very frequently encountered in telecommunication systems modeling, and provides simple methods for analyzing them. Where appropriate, alternative analysis methods are also presented. This book is for advanced-level students and researchers concentrating on engineering, computer science and mathematics as a secondary text or reference book. Professionals who work in the related industries of telecommunications, industrial engineering and communications engineering will find this book useful as well.",

The authors' vast experience and their insights in applying this technique to patients with melanoma will be invaluable to any surgical oncology team contemplating introducing this approach to management of their patients. A section on lymphatic drainage patterns of the breast is also included, based on 90 studies of breast cancer patients. The new lymphatic drainage pathways described will also be of interest to other surgeons and anatomists.",

    "summary": "Originally published between 1909 and 1917 under the name \"Harvard Classics,\" this stupendous 51-volume set-a collection of the greatest writings from literature, philosophy, history, and mythology-was assembled by American academic CHARLES WILLIAM ELIOT (1834-1926), Harvard University's longest-serving president. Also known as \"Dr. Eliot's Five Foot Shelf,\" it represented Eliot's belief that a basic liberal education could be gleaned by reading from an anthology of works that could fit on five feet of bookshelf. Volume XXV contains works by two great 19th-century writers: On Liberty, the greatest work from British political philosopher JOHN STUART MILL (1806-1873), often mentioned in the same breath with the Communist Manifesto; and his 1873 autobiography, in which Mill reveals how his life was inextricably connected to that of his father, Scottish philosopher James Mill. And from Mill's close friend, Scottish essayist THOMAS CARLYLE (1795-1881): the 1831 essay \"Characteristics,\" a critique of Romanticism; \"Inaugural Address at Edinburgh,\" from 1866, a fascinating and telling summary of his own intellectual history; and an 1838 piece, \"Sir Walter Scott,\" that explains the ethical rather than aesthetic foundations of his literary criticism. English philosopher and politician JOHN STUART MILL (1806-1873) served as an administrator in the East Indian Company from 1823 to 1858, and as a member of parliament from 1865 to 1868. Among his essays on a wide range of political and social thought are Principles of Political Economy (1848), Considerations on Representative Government (1861), Utilitarianism (1863), and The Subjection of Women (1869).",

    "summary": "Pro HTML5 Accessibility helps designers come to grips with building exciting, accessible and usable web sites and applications with HTML5. The book covers how to use HTML5 in order to serve the needs of people with disabilities and older persons using assistive technology (AT). It aims to be a useful �go-to� guide, providing practical advice. It takes several approaches, including a look at the new semantics of HTML5 and how to combine its use with authoring practices you know from using earlier versions of HTML. It also demonstrates how HTML5 content is currently supported (or not) by assistive technologies such as screen readers, and what this means practically for accessibility in your web projects. The HTML5 specification is huge, with new APIs and patterns that can be difficult to understand. Accessibility can also seem complex and nuanced if you have no experience interacting with people with disabilities. This book walks you though the process of designing exciting user interfaces that can potentially be used by everyone, regardless of ability. Accessibility is really a quality design issue, and getting it right is often more a matter of approach than having sophisticated, cutting-edge tools at your disposal. This book will be your companion in your journey to understand both HTML5 and accessibility, as the author has many years of experience as a designer and web developer working directly with people with all types of disabilities. He has been involved with the development of HTML5 from an accessibility perspective for many years, as a member of the W3C WAI Protocols and Formats working group (which is responsible for ensuring W3C specifications are serving the needs of people with disabilities) as well as the HTML5 Working Group itself. Introduces the new HTML5 specification from an accessibility perspective Shows how incorporating accessibility into your interfaces using HTML5 can have benefits for all users Explains how HTML5 is currently supported by assistive technologies like screen readers, and how to work around these limitations when developing What you�ll learn Gain an overview of assistive technologies and how they work with web content, as well as how to approach accessibility in your design projects Learn how HTML5 differs from HTML4 and earlier Understand how to practically apply HTML5 to your web projects in order to design accessible content. See what works and what doesn�t Learn the new semantics and structures within HTML5, and how to use them to build more accessible websites and applications See which HTML5 elements and attributes are supported by browsers and assistive technologies, and what this means for the user experience of people with disabilities Understand which parts of HTML5 are not well supported by browsers and assistive technology Get a snapshot of current support, its limitations, and how to design and code in a way that will support older assistive technologies and browsers as well as more feature-rich, newer technologies Learn how CSS, JavaScript, and WAI-ARIA can be used with HTML5 to support the development of accessible web content Who this book is for Pro HTML5 Accessibility is for the intermediate to advanced web designer and developer who is already building websites and applications but needs some help in understanding accessibility and how it relates to HTML5. The book can be read as a basic introduction to HTML5 and accessibility, but may be more suited to the professional or experienced designer who already has knowledge of HTML4 (or earlier) as well as CSS, WAI-ARIA and JavaScript. While no detailed knowledge of CSS, WAI-ARIA or scripting is really required, it will help the reader to understand some of the design patterns and examples discussed in the book.

    "summary": "HTML5 is here, and with it, rich Internet applications (RIAs) take on a power, ease, scalability, and responsiveness that neither Ajax nor Comet could ever achieve. With this book, developers will learn how to use the latest cutting-edge web technology�available in the most recent versions of modern browsers�to build real-time web applications with unparalleled functionality, speed, and responsiveness. The HTML5 specification represents the next evolution�or rather, a revolution�of web communications required to build real-time applications. WebSockets and server-sent events provide not only a standard against which real-time web applications can be built, but also a socket, native to the browser, that facilitates network programming from the browser with efficient bidirectional (full-duplex) communication over a single connection. As the central theme for the examples of this book, author Peter Lubbers draws on his experience as an ultra�long distance runner (try 165 miles in one go). He combines his passion for cutting-edge technology with real-life race scenarios in a way that will inspire you to take these new HTML5 features�such as such as real-time race tracking, GPS integration, geo location, and live chat�to the limits. Explains how you can create real-time HTML5 applications that tap the full potential of modern browsers Provides practical, real-world examples of HTML5 features in action Shows which HTML5 features are supported in current browsers and platforms What you�ll learn How the HTML5 specification has evolved How to design, develop, and run cutting-edge real-time web applications using new HTML5 features like WebSockets, server-sent events, cross-document messaging, geo location, storage, canvas, and video Which features are available in browsers today and how you can run your applications in older browsers that do not support HTML5 features How to use client-side APIs to communicate directly with back-end systems such as messaging systems, JMS brokers, XMPP servers, and online services such as Google Wave Who is this book for? This book is for developers who want to use the latest cutting-edge technology available in current browsers; developers who want to create dynamic, data-driven web applications; and developers who want to know which HTML5 features are supported in current browsers.",

Even though the specification is still in development, many modern browsers and mobile devices already support HTML5 and CSS3. This book gets you up to speed on the new HTML5 elements and CSS3 features you can use right now, and backwards compatible solutions ensure that you don't leave users of older browsers behind. This book gets you started working with many useful new features of HTML5 and CSS3 right away. Gone are the days of adding additional markup just to style a button differently or stripe tables. You'll learn to use HTML5's new markup to create better structure for your content and better interfaces for your forms, resulting in cleaner, easier-to-read code that can be understood by both humans and programs. You'll find out how to embed audio, video, and vector graphics into your pages without using Flash. You'll see how web sockets, client-side storage, offline caching, and cross-document messaging can ease the pain of modern web development. And you'll discover how simple CSS3 makes it to style sections of your page. Throughout the book, you'll learn how to compensate for situations where your users can't take advantage of HTML5 and CSS3 yet, developing solutions that are backwards compatible and accessible. You'll find what you need quickly with this book's modular structure, and get hands-on with a tutorial project for each new HTML5 and CSS3 feature covered. \"Falling Back\" sections show you how to create solutions for older browsers, and \"The Future\" sections at the end of each chapter get you excited about the possibilities when HTML5 and CSS3 reach widespread adoption.

    "summary": "This is the book for web designers, web developers, and front-end coders who want to get up to speed with HTML5 in 2012. This is the book that isn�t afraid to point out what everyone gets wrong about HTML5�s new markup, so you don�t make the same mistakes. This is the book that will show you what rocks in HTML5 today and what the future holds for interactivity and video now Flash is dying. This is the book that doesn�t think marking up a basic web page should be a quasi-religious exercise where the high priests of HTML5 must be consulted for their interpretation of the holy texts (the HTML5 spec). This is the book that doesn�t pull its punches. This is the book for web professionals who think for themselves. This is the book that tells the truth about HTML5. === 5 Reasons You Should Read The Truth About HTML5 1. Learn HTML5 markup the right way After spending an insane number of hours researching HTML5�s new markup I discovered one disturbing fact: everyone gets it wrong. Really. Don�t waste hours trawling through confusing, poorly researched, and often flat-out wrong blog posts (or books). Get the truth on HTML5�s markup in chapter three and chapter four. 2. Learn about the future of semantics Did you know Google, Yahoo! and Microsoft teamed up in 2011 to launch a new, potentially groundbreaking semantics initiative using HTML5�s new microdata standard? They did, and the new semantics are being used by major sites like eBay and IMDB right now. In chapter seven you�ll be brought up to speed on one of the biggest changes to semantics to ever hit the web. 3. Learn what HTML5 features you can implement today HTML5 isn�t one big blob of technology that will be \"finished\" at some point in the future. It�s a grab bag of cool stuff, much of which has been around for years. Learn what�s well supported and ready to go today in 2012, including new forms features in chapter eight, and the new audio and video possibilities in chapter ten. 4. Learn what happens when Flash dies The writing is on the wall for Flash. Apple never supported it on mobile; Adobe (Adobe!) have given up on the plug-in for Android; and Microsoft won�t support it in IE10 in the default desktop experience of Windows 8. (Let that sink in for a moment.) Clients will demand HTML5 equivalents of what was done with Flash so we�ll look at what HTML�s Canvas can do in chapter nine and what HTML5 video can (and can�t) do in chapter ten. 5. HTML5 for CMSs, and beyond HTML5 Finally in chapter twelve we�ll look at some of the web app oriented features of HTML5, one of which (the History API) changes something as fundamental as a page refresh. We�ll also touch on features that we should be demanding asking politely to be included in our CMSs, and we�ll look briefly at some post-HTML5 web standards development for mobile that�s becoming a reality right now.",

    "summary": "HTML5 and CSS3 (the latest standards for HTML and cascading style sheets) are packed with coding options that make it easier than ever to create web pages with the features users want today, from an up-to-date look and feel...to immediate validation of user entries...to audio and video samplings. At the same time, there are still older browsers and millions of existing web sites that require you to integrate HTML5 and CSS3 features with the earlier standards. So how do you learn all this?This book is exactly the practical approach you need. It teaches you how to use HTML5 and CSS3 the way they were meant to work, with HTML5 to provide the page content and CSS3 to format the content and lay out the pages. But it also teaches you how to use the HTML5 and CSS3 features alongside the earlier standards to ensure that your pages will work for the widest possible audience. So if you're going to be developing web pages...whether you're a web designer, a JavaScript programmer, a server-side programmer, or a rookie...this book is for you.It begins with a 6-chapter, quick-start course to get you working at the professional level right away. Soon, you'll be using HTML5 features...like the semantic tags that improve the structure of your content and your search engine rankings...along with CSS3 features...like text and border shadows, rounded corners, and background gradients that give your pages a cutting-edge feel. And you'll know how and when to blend them with the earlier HTML and CSS code.After that quick-start, you'll learn how to make your pages work better for your site visitors by enhancing them with audio and video files...using the jQuery Mobile library to deliver content on mobile devices...adding jQuery routines for special effects like slide shows and accordions...and using JavaScript to provide for features like geolocation, web storage, canvas, and drag-and-drop...the kinds of skills that go far beyond what you'll find in other introductory books.",

    "summary": "Want to create exciting HTML5 graphics without spending eternity in JavaScript? You can! This provides a basic overview of the two declarative languages bound to HTML5 � CSS 3.0 and Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG). The decision to incorporate both has to do with the fairly tight relationship that SVG has with CSS and with HTML and the desire to focus on a book that provides only moderate JavaScript code usage. SVG is now supported in all contemporary browsers with the release of SVG support in Internet Explorer 9.0, meaning that it has now reached a point where web developers can make use of its power. This piece provides a jumping off point for developers who want to use SVG in HTML5.",

Games can now be created and interacted with directly within HTML with no need for users to download extra plugins, or for developers to learn new languages. Important new features such as the Canvas tag enable drawing directly onto the web page, the Audio tag allows sounds to be triggered and played from within your HTML code, the web sockets API brings the facility for real-time communication, and the local storage API enables data such as high scores or game preferences to be kept on a user's computer to be retrieved next time they play your game. All of these features and many more are covered within The Essential Guide to HTML5. This book begins at an introductory level, teaching the essentials of HTML5 and JavaScript through game development. Each chapter features a familiar game type as its core example, such as hangman, rock-paper-scissors, or dice games, and uses these simple constructs to build a solid skillset of the key HTML5 concepts and features. By working through these hands on examples, you will gain a deep, practical knowledge of HTML5 that will enable you to build your own, more advanced games and applications.

    "summary": "A combination primer and reference manual specific to Microsoft Internet Explorer 5, IE5 Dynamic HTML Programmer's Reference is a very useful companion for Web coders. The first half of this title presents dynamic HTML (DHTML) rapidly yet thoroughly. The rear of the book comprises a series of reference tables and listings that form a quite comprehensive repository of coding information. The book begins with an overview of DHTML, followed by a look at how style sheets let you assert much greater control over your pages than plain HTML. The authors then explain the Dynamic HTML Browser Object Model and the Dynamic HTML Document Object in depth, pointing out along the way how each provides control over page and element levels. With this background covered, the book then moves into dynamic techniques such as event handling, scripting, and manipulating page elements. The first part concludes with a useful discussion of data binding and a quick introduction to Extensible Markup Language (XML). The reference portion of the book includes a formal specification for the Browser Object Model, as well as DHTML properties, methods, and events. Next comes a full listing of DHTML tags with syntax specifications and code examples. This section doesn't stop with DHTML, however. It also includes tutorials for VBScript, JScript, and special character tables, making this book a well-rounded tool. --Stephen W Plain",

    "summary": "HTML5 is a language for structuring and presenting content for the World Wide Web, a core technology of the Internet. It is the fifth revision of the HTML standard (originally created in 1990 and most recently standardized as HTML4 in 1997) and as of June 2011 was still under development. Its core aims have been to improve the language with support for the latest multimedia while keeping it easily readable by humans and consistently understood by computers and devices (web browsers, parsers etc.). HTML5 is intended to subsume not only HTML4, but XHTML1 and DOM2HTML (particularly JavaScript) as well. Following its immediate predecessors HTML 4.01 and XHTML 1.1, HTML5 is a response to the observation that the HTML and XHTML in common use on the World Wide Web is a mixture of features introduced by various specifications, along with those introduced by software products such as web browsers, those established by common practice, and the many syntax errors in existing web documents. It is also an attempt to define a single markup language that can be written in either HTML or XHTML syntax. It includes detailed processing models to encourage more interoperable implementations; it extends, improves and rationalises the markup available for documents, and introduces markup and APIs for complex web applications. This book is your ultimate resource for HTML5. Here you will find the most up-to-date information, analysis, background and everything you need to know. In easy to read chapters, with extensive references and links to get you to know all there is to know about HTML5 right away, covering: HTML5, Adobe Wallaby, HTML5 File API, HTML5 in mobile devices, Talk:Lord of Ultima, Maqetta, Schema.org, Sencha Touch, The cache manifest in HTML5, HTML, Alt attribute, Blink element, Blockquote element, Canonical meta tag, Canvas element, CE-HTML, Character encodings in HTML, Character entity reference,",

    "summary": "Free chapters and the book's code are available at CoreHTML5Canvas.comOne of HTML5's most exciting features, Canvas provides a powerful 2D graphics API that lets you implement everything from word processors to video games. In Core HTML5 Canvas, best-selling author David Geary presents a code-fueled, no-nonsense deep dive into that API, covering everything you need to know to implement rich and consistent web applications that run on a wide variety of operating systems and devices. Succinctly and clearly written, this book examines dozens of real-world uses of the Canvas API, such as interactively drawing and manipulating shapes, saving and restoring the drawing surface to temporarily draw shapes and text, and implementing text controls. You'll see how to keep your applications responsive with web workers when you filter images, how to implement smooth animations, and how to create layered, 3D scrolling backgrounds with parallax. In addition, you'll see how to implement video games with extensive coverage of sprites, physics, collision detection, and the implementation of a game engine and an industrial-strength pinball game. The book concludes by showing you how to implement Canvas-based controls that you can use in any HTML5 application and how to use Canvas on mobile devices, including iOS5. This authoritative Canvas reference covers The canvas element--using it with other HTML elements, handling events, printing a canvas, and using offscreen canvases Shapes--drawing, dragging, erasing, and editing lines, arcs, circles, curves, and polygons; using shadows, gradients, and patterns Text--drawing, positioning, setting font properties; building text controls Images--drawing, scaling, clipping, processing, and animating Animations--creating smooth, efficient, and portable animations Sprites--implementing animated objects that have painters and behaviors Physics--modeling physical systems (falling bodies, pendulums, and projectiles), and implementing tweening for nonlinear motion and animation Collision detection--advanced techniques, clearly explained Game development--all aspects of game development, such as time-based motion and high score support, implemented in a game engine Custom controls--infrastructure for implementing custom controls; implementing progress bars, sliders, and an image panner Mobile applications--fitting Canvas apps on a mobile screen, using media queries, handling touch events, and specifying iOS5 artifacts, such as app icons Throughout the book, Geary discusses high-quality, reusable code to help professional developers learn everything they really need to know, with no unnecessary verbiage. All of the book's code and live demonstrations of key techniques are available at CoreHTML5Canvas.com.",

In many ways it is very similar to desktop Web site development - HTML5 is HTML5 no matter what device you install it on.What is different is how you use and interface with the device. Smartphones and tablets like the iPad, iPhone, and android devices are just very different than laptops and desktops. Find out how to work within mobile versions of popular web browsers while maximizing your design with HTML5 and CSS3 basics. Discover how to place items, work with fonts, and control color detail as well as other critical yet simple design elements.Work on graphical control with Bitmap, SVG and Canvas elements",

    "summary": "This innovative product is an in-depth video training course and accompanying 48-page full-color book, aimed at web designers looking to make the leap to cutting-edge Web technologies using Adobe Dreamweaver CS5.5. Dreamweaver CS5.5 provides designers with the tools needed to build modern websites with HTML5, CSS3, and jQuery. In this video course, experienced author and trainer David Powers explains which parts of HTML5 and CSS3 you can use now with confidence. He shows how to convert existing pages to HTML5 and build new ones from scratch. You�ll also learn how to create CSS3 effects�such as drop shadows, rounded corners, and transparency�without the need for images. In addition, David shows how to choose the right CSS selector, knowledge that you'll find indispensible not only for creating style rules, but also for working with jQuery. The course takes you through the process of adapting for mobile phones and tablets a website that was originally designed for desktop computers. You�ll learn how to use CSS media queries to apply different styles depending on screen width, viewing the changes in real time in Dreamweaver�s Live view. The course concludes with an introduction to jQuery, and demonstrates how to enhance online forms with the help of Dreamweaver CS5.5�s built-in code hints for jQuery. This product includes over eight hours of exceptional quality video tutorials, with lesson files, assessment quizzes, and review materials. The video is wrapped in a unique interface that allows the viewer to jump to any topic and also bookmark individual sections for later review. The unique Watch-and-Work mode shrinks the video into a small window to allow the student to work alongside in Dreamweaver. Project files used in the lessons are included on the disc so viewers can practice what they've learned, and interactive review questions help reinforce freshly gained knowledge. Selected videos can be downloaded for viewing on iPhones, iPods, and other compatible mobile devices. The DVD-ROM is bundled with a printed booklet that provides supplemental material to enhance the video training.",

    "summary": "Foundation Website Creation with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript shows the entire process of building a website. This process involves much more than just technical knowledge, and this book provides all the information you'll need to understand the concepts behind designing and developing for the Web, as well as the best means to deliver professional results based on best practices. Of course, there is far more to building a successful website than knowing a little Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). The process starts long before any coding takes place, and this book introduces you to the agile development process, explaining why this method makes so much sense for web projects and how best to implement it. We also make sure you're up to date by using the latest HTML5 features. Planning is vital, so you'll also learn to use techniques such as brainstorming, wireframes, mockups, and prototypes to get your project off to the best possible start and help ensure smooth progress as it develops. An understanding of correct, semantic markup is essential for any web professional; this book explains how HTML5 should be used to structure content so that the markup adheres to current web standards. You'll learn about the wide range of HTML5 elements available to you, and you'll learn how and when to use them through building example web pages. Without creative use of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), websites would all look largely the same. CSS enables you to set your website apart from the rest, while maintaining the integrity of your markup. We'll showcase the new features of CSS3 and how you can use them. You'll learn how CSS3 works and how to apply styles to your pages, allowing you to realize your design ideas in the browser. JavaScript can be used to make your website easier and more interesting to use. This book provides information on appropriate uses of this technology and introduces the concepts of JavaScript programming. You'll also see how JavaScript works as part of the much-hyped technique Ajax, and in turn, where Ajax fits into the wider Web 2.0 picture. While a website is being built, it needs to be tested across multiple browsers and platforms to ensure that the site works for all users, regardless of ability or disability, and this book explains how best to accomplish these tasks. Then, it discusses the process of launching and maintaining the site so that it will continue to work for all its users throughout its life cycle. Foundation Website Creation with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript concludes by covering server-side technologies, acting as a guide to the different options available. With insights from renowned experts such as Jason Fried of 37signals, Daniel Burka of Digg and Pownce, and Chris Messina of Citizen Agency, Foundation Website Creation with CSS, XHTML, and JavaScript provides invaluable information applicable to every web project�regardless of size, scope, or budget. What you�ll learn See how the Web has developed and the role of web standards Learn how to plan and manage the building of a website Learn how to separate content from presentation with HTML5 and CSS3 See how JavaScript can be used to enhance your website Learn how best to test, launch, and maintain a website Who this book is for Web developers and designers starting out in HTML5 and CSS3.

THTML incorporates temporal logic into HTML to provide an efficient solution for authoring and maintaining <italic>time-sensitive</italic> web sites. In THTML, the same URL request may result in different HTML pages for different request times. This request time may be the local time that the reader sends the request, or it may be sometime in the past or even the future. The HTML page sent in response to the request is an instance of the page determined by the particular time context, i.e. the reader's request time. The instance is generated using the THTML source files for each web component whose time interval stamps most closely approximate the time specified. With <italic> server push</italic> technology incorporated into the design, the THTML server periodically re-instantiates the previously requested URLs in each web session and re-issues the updated instances as time elapses. THTML 1.0 implemented the above design partially.",

Microsoft Windows 8 Principal Evangelist Jaime Rodriguez guides developers through constructing a real Windows 8 Metro app from start to finish, using expert techniques and Microsoft-recommended coding patterns and practices. Along the way, Rodriguez shares unprecedented insider insights into Windows 8 and Metro, making this an outstanding introduction to the platform for any developer. Readers will start by taking a \"lap\" around a typical Windows 8 Metro-style application, understanding its elements, how they fit together, and how Metro development differs from what they've done before. Rodgriguez introduces Microsoft's development tools and resources for Windows 8 Metro development, including Visual Studio 11, Expression Blend, and Windows Library for JavaScript (WinJS). Readers learn how to integrate data with REST, JSON, and XmlHttpRequest; use Microsoft's new Metro controls and Store API; manage views; provide notifications; provide multi-touch interface support; integrate with hardware, the shell, and the Windows 8 OS, and much more. Useful reference appendices present HTML5 and CSS3 standards, Metro design principles for developers, and more.",

In this book, multiple best-selling Microsoft web development author Stephen Walther shows them exactly how to leverage this remarkable new opportunity. This comprehensive, in-depth guide covers everything web developers need to know to get the job done. Walther thoroughly explains the unique advantages of Metro applications, and demonstrates how to use Microsoft's fully array of new JavaScript technologies to build them - including JavaScript templates, controls, data binding, and the entire new Windows Library for JavaScript (WinJS). From accessing the Windows Runtime to distributing applications through Microsoft's new App Store, this book brings together all the knowledge needed to build successful production software. From start to finish, readers will find the same exceptionally insightful coverage and practical code that made Walther's \"ASP.NET Unleashed\" the top-selling ASP.NET book of all time.",

Alexandria Stone is a physician with all the techniques of modern medicine at her disposal, but when an x-ray of a mummy found at her father's archeological dig reveals a procedure that hadn't been developed four thousand years ago, her excitement overcomes her scientist's logic. Determined to prove her theory, she visits her father's dig. In the hidden room of a pharaoh's tomb, her father discovers an ancient scroll lying near a statue of the goddess, Isis. When Alex attempts to sing the song written on it, she is transported back in time -- and right into the arms of the best looking hunk she's ever encountered: Tarik, chief physician to Pharaoh Mentuhotep. Despite his attraction to the lovely time traveler, Tarik is bound by honor to give her to Pharaoh as his concubine. A world of implausible sights and unimaginable pleasures captivates Alex's senses, while the love of Tarik holds her heart spellbound even as she tries to unravel the magical secret of THE SONG OF ISIS.",

Ariana Zoltan has no choice but to work with her Jotnar overlords, but does everything she can to ease the slaves' suffering. If that means using her powers to spot potential runners, so be it.

    "summary": "No matter how visually appealing or content packed a web site may be, if it doesn�t reach the widest possible audience, it isn�t truly successful. In Bulletproof Web Design, Third Edition, bestselling author and web designer Dan Cederholm outlines standards-based strategies for building designs that can accommodate the myriad ways users choose to view the content. Each chapter starts out with an example of an unbulletproof approach--one that employs traditional HTML-based techniques--which Dan deconstructs, pointing out its limitations. He then gives the example a makeover using HTML and CSS, so you can learn to replace bloated code with lean markup and CSS for fast-loading sites that are accessible to all users. Finally, he assembles all of the page components discussed in prior chapters into a single-page template. This fully revised and updated third edition introduces CSS3 and HTML5 methods and features redesigned case studies including new responsive design examples.Size text using keywords, percentages, and ems to allow more user control.

Designed to appeal to underprepared students and readers turned off by dense text Cartoons, sidebars, icons, and other graphic pointers get the material across fast Concise text focuses on the essence of the subject Deliver expert help from teachers who are authorities in their fields Perfect for last-minute test preparation So small and light that they fit in a backpack!",

The book is up-to-date, covering HTML 4, Netscape Navigator 4, Microsoft Internet Explorer 4, and the various extensions of each. HTML: The Definitive Guide is aimed at beginners as well as those who have more practice in Web-page creation. The authors assume at least a basic knowledge of computers, including how to use a word processor or text editor and how to deal with files. They teach you that learning HTML is like learning any other language and that reading a book of rules can only take you so far. Readers begin writing what may be their first Web page just two pages into the book's second chapter. From there on, they provide a wide range of HTML coding to allow readers to learn from good examples. The book includes a handy \"cheat sheet\" of HTML codes for quick reference. --Elizabeth Lewis",

    "summary": "Dynamic HTML for Dummies explains how to take advantage of the decorative and functional HTML enhancements that Microsoft Internet Explorer can display. This book does a fine job of introducing Web developers to Microsoft's additions to the standard Web publishing language. In Dynamic HTML for Dummies, readers get exposed to filters, cascading style sheets, and event-driven interactivity. Rather than document Dynamic HTML (DHTML) fully, the author chooses to present a sort of \"best of\" collection, revealing the code behind the DHTML tricks that interest most publishers. As a result, it contains the HTML recipes for many effects you've seen on the Web. While JScript greatly influences the creation of DHTML documents, Hyman refrains from making his book a comprehensive scripting text. Instead, he presents only the components of JScript necessary for writing DHTML event handlers and animations. He leaves detailed coverage of the language to more specialized books. Readers should walk away with a decent grasp of the DHTML object model, ready to explore it in greater depth. The main shortcoming of Dynamic HTML for Dummies derives from its focus on Internet Explorer 4.x, now outmoded by version 5. The good news is that much of the material carries over to the new release. --David Wall",

    "summary": "Even if you rely on online documentation for Web-page design, there's nothing like a handy, one-volume guide to the essentials of HTML and dynamic HTML (DHTML) standards. That's the idea behind Instant HTML, a much-needed reference that helps you get the most out of Web-page design and create cutting-edge cross-browser content.Early chapters describe the basic terms and technologies, including HTML, JavaScript, VBScript, ECMAScript (a new, vender-neutral alternative), and DHTML. The authors then give a step-by-step tour of basic Web-page design, from the basic tags used in creating simple pages to style sheets, images, and links to other pages. Further chapters take on tables, frames, and forms and teach you how to use Java applets and ActiveX components within HTML. The authors show the differences between JavaScript and VBScript and, where appropriate, point out new features in emerging HTML 4 specifications. Each topic is illustrated with concise examples, and the authors note what does and doesn't work in Netscape Navigator 4 and Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.The last part of the book will probably be useful to even the most seasoned HTML developer. Chapters explain how to design with DHTML in both Navigator 4 and Internet Explorer 4, displaying useful sample pages for each browser and offering tips on how to create cross-platform content for both browsers. Finally, since this is a reference book, valuable appendices are included for HTML tags, JavaScript and VBScript basics, and other information Internet developers will find useful.",

Many individuals and organizations have used this medium as the new, online equivalent of desktop publishing, and are now ready to create exciting, technically ambitious Web sites to capture the fleeting attention of the net surfer. This book is for the thousands of Web site developers who have already learned the basics of HTML and want to learn the secrets behind cool Web sites by using HTML's advanced features to create awesome special effects. HTML HACKER'S HANDBOOK gives readers the information they need about this cutting-edge technology and illustrates the Web site's true potential with many examples. Most developers suspect that these effects are not difficult to master (and they aren't), but until now there hasn't been a source describing how to actually implement the cool Web features they have seen. Includes discussions of Java, ActiveX, Frames and more. Sample HTML files, shareware, and utilities are included on the CD.",

    "summary": "For web developers building rich web and mobile applications, standards-based CSS3 offers powerful advantages over traditional Flash-based approaches - and since Apple's immensely popular iPad and iPhone don't support Flash, moving to CSS3 has become even more urgent. However, most CSS3 guides focus primarily on the basics, frustrating web developers who want to do sophisticated work. Learning CSS3 Animations and Transitions is the first book focused entirely on creating production-quality rich animations and transitions with CSS3. Leading web development trainer Alexis Goldstein covers everything web developers need to know, teaching through solid examples that help web professionals build their skills one step at a time. Readers will learn how to: * Create 2D transforms that serve as the foundation for CSS3 animations * Use transitions to make changes come alive * Master essential keyframing techniques * Combine transitions, transforms, and parallax scrolling in immersive web experiences * Transform in 3D, and animate 3D transforms * Creating increasingly complex and Flash-style animations * Build powerfully effective interactive infographics with CSS3 and HTML5 * And much more...",

Readers will appreciate the author's approachable style and will catch on quickly with this easy-to-follow, practical guide. Well known and respected CSS3 expert Chris Mills devotes much of the book to creating fallbacks for older browsers, so that the content will still be accessible and usable.Each chapter begins with a quick reference sheet with all the syntax, fallbacks, backward compatibility, and browser support (including mobile). The author clearly explains what the CSS features do and why they are useful. Then he demonstrates a simple design that illustrates usage, followed by more complex variations. The chapter then covers appropriate fallbacks/shivs for older browser support and problems that currently exist for that feature. Topics include CSS3 typography, bling boxes, navigation buttons, animated effects using CSS3, using CSS3 to implement icons, CSS3 layout chops, adaptive layouts and responsive design, fluid layouts and percentages, and styling media. The book's companion website offers a PDF of each chapter's cheat sheet, as well as sample code used in the book, available for free download and updated regularly.",

    "summary": "CSS3 (Cascading Style Sheets 3) is the next major revision of the style sheet language that is used to describe the presentation (the appearance and formatting) of web pages written in HTML. CSS is designed primarily to enable the separation of document content (written in HTML or a similar markup language) from document presentation, including elements such as the colors, fonts, and layout. The CSS specification is developed and maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Different types and versions of web browsers, however, implement parts of the CSS specification incompletely and with varying levels of consistency. Although CSS 3 is still far from final, some parts of the specification have reached Candidate Recommendation stage, which has allowed the most recent versions of major browsers to begin to support these parts of the specification. Sams Teach Yourself CSS in 24 Hours is a carefully organized, well-written tutorial that teaches the beginning web page designer how to use CSS to specify how their web page will appear when displayed within a web browser. Learning to effectively use CSS is a critical developmental step for anyone aspiring to professional-level web page design skills. In 24 straightforward one-hour lessons, the reader learns by accomplishing hands-on tasks that can be applied to your own site. Teaches CSS in a straightforward and clear language that any beginner can understand Complete details on using CSS with all modern browsers",

Even though the specification is still in development, many modern browsers and mobile devices already support HTML5 and CSS3. This book gets you up to speed on the new HTML5 elements and CSS3 features you can use right now, and backwards compatible solutions ensure that you don't leave users of older browsers behind. This book gets you started working with many useful new features of HTML5 and CSS3 right away. Gone are the days of adding additional markup just to style a button differently or stripe tables. You'll learn to use HTML5's new markup to create better structure for your content and better interfaces for your forms, resulting in cleaner, easier-to-read code that can be understood by both humans and programs. You'll find out how to embed audio, video, and vector graphics into your pages without using Flash. You'll see how web sockets, client-side storage, offline caching, and cross-document messaging can ease the pain of modern web development. And you'll discover how simple CSS3 makes it to style sections of your page. Throughout the book, you'll learn how to compensate for situations where your users can't take advantage of HTML5 and CSS3 yet, developing solutions that are backwards compatible and accessible. You'll find what you need quickly with this book's modular structure, and get hands-on with a tutorial project for each new HTML5 and CSS3 feature covered. \"Falling Back\" sections show you how to create solutions for older browsers, and \"The Future\" sections at the end of each chapter get you excited about the possibilities when HTML5 and CSS3 reach widespread adoption. Get ready for the future---in fact, it's here already.",

    "summary": "HTML5 and CSS3 (the latest standards for HTML and cascading style sheets) are packed with coding options that make it easier than ever to create web pages with the features users want today, from an up-to-date look and feel...to immediate validation of user entries...to audio and video samplings. At the same time, there are still older browsers and millions of existing web sites that require you to integrate HTML5 and CSS3 features with the earlier standards. So how do you learn all this?This book is exactly the practical approach you need. It teaches you how to use HTML5 and CSS3 the way they were meant to work, with HTML5 to provide the page content and CSS3 to format the content and lay out the pages. But it also teaches you how to use the HTML5 and CSS3 features alongside the earlier standards to ensure that your pages will work for the widest possible audience. So if you're going to be developing web pages...whether you're a web designer, a JavaScript programmer, a server-side programmer, or a rookie...this book is for you.It begins with a 6-chapter, quick-start course to get you working at the professional level right away. Soon, you'll be using HTML5 features...like the semantic tags that improve the structure of your content and your search engine rankings...along with CSS3 features...like text and border shadows, rounded corners, and background gradients that give your pages a cutting-edge feel. And you'll know how and when to blend them with the earlier HTML and CSS code.After that quick-start, you'll learn how to make your pages work better for your site visitors by enhancing them with audio and video files...using the jQuery Mobile library to deliver content on mobile devices...adding jQuery routines for special effects like slide shows and accordions...and using JavaScript to provide for features like geolocation, web storage, canvas, and drag-and-drop...the kinds of skills that go far beyond what you'll find in other introductory books.",

This provides a basic overview of the two declarative languages bound to HTML5 � CSS 3.0 and Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG). The decision to incorporate both has to do with the fairly tight relationship that SVG has with CSS and with HTML and the desire to focus on a book that provides only moderate JavaScript code usage. SVG is now supported in all contemporary browsers with the release of SVG support in Internet Explorer 9.0, meaning that it has now reached a point where web developers can make use of its power. This piece provides a jumping off point for developers who want to use SVG in HTML5.",

    "summary": "Foundation Website Creation with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript shows the entire process of building a website. This process involves much more than just technical knowledge, and this book provides all the information you'll need to understand the concepts behind designing and developing for the Web, as well as the best means to deliver professional results based on best practices. Of course, there is far more to building a successful website than knowing a little Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). The process starts long before any coding takes place, and this book introduces you to the agile development process, explaining why this method makes so much sense for web projects and how best to implement it. We also make sure you're up to date by using the latest HTML5 features. Planning is vital, so you'll also learn to use techniques such as brainstorming, wireframes, mockups, and prototypes to get your project off to the best possible start and help ensure smooth progress as it develops. An understanding of correct, semantic markup is essential for any web professional; this book explains how HTML5 should be used to structure content so that the markup adheres to current web standards. You'll learn about the wide range of HTML5 elements available to you, and you'll learn how and when to use them through building example web pages. Without creative use of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), websites would all look largely the same. CSS enables you to set your website apart from the rest, while maintaining the integrity of your markup. We'll showcase the new features of CSS3 and how you can use them. You'll learn how CSS3 works and how to apply styles to your pages, allowing you to realize your design ideas in the browser. JavaScript can be used to make your website easier and more interesting to use. This book provides information on appropriate uses of this technology and introduces the concepts of JavaScript programming. You'll also see how JavaScript works as part of the much-hyped technique Ajax, and in turn, where Ajax fits into the wider Web 2.0 picture. While a website is being built, it needs to be tested across multiple browsers and platforms to ensure that the site works for all users, regardless of ability or disability, and this book explains how best to accomplish these tasks. Then, it discusses the process of launching and maintaining the site so that it will continue to work for all its users throughout its life cycle. Foundation Website Creation with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript concludes by covering server-side technologies, acting as a guide to the different options available. With insights from renowned experts such as Jason Fried of 37signals, Daniel Burka of Digg and Pownce, and Chris Messina of Citizen Agency, Foundation Website Creation with CSS, XHTML, and JavaScript provides invaluable information applicable to every web project�regardless of size, scope, or budget. What you�ll learn See how the Web has developed and the role of web standards Learn how to plan and manage the building of a website Learn how to separate content from presentation with HTML5 and CSS3 See how JavaScript can be used to enhance your website Learn how best to test, launch, and maintain a website Who this book is for Web developers and designers starting out in HTML5 and CSS3.

In Bulletproof Web Design, Third Edition, bestselling author and web designer Dan Cederholm outlines standards-based strategies for building designs that can accommodate the myriad ways users choose to view the content. Each chapter starts out with an example of an unbulletproof approach--one that employs traditional HTML-based techniques--which Dan deconstructs, pointing out its limitations. He then gives the example a makeover using HTML and CSS, so you can learn to replace bloated code with lean markup and CSS for fast-loading sites that are accessible to all users. Finally, he assembles all of the page components discussed in prior chapters into a single-page template. This fully revised and updated third edition introduces CSS3 and HTML5 methods and features redesigned case studies including new responsive design examples.Size text using keywords, percentages, and ems to allow more user control. Plan for vertical expansion of horizontal page components. Use floats to achieve grid-like results. Ensure that content is still readable in the absence of images or CSS. Strip the presentation from data tables, and rebuild with CSS. Progressively enhance your designs using HTML5 and CSS3.

Dreamweaver CS5.5 provides designers with the tools needed to build modern websites with HTML5, CSS3, and jQuery. In this video course, experienced author and trainer David Powers explains which parts of HTML5 and CSS3 you can use now with confidence. He shows how to convert existing pages to HTML5 and build new ones from scratch. You�ll also learn how to create CSS3 effects�such as drop shadows, rounded corners, and transparency�without the need for images. In addition, David shows how to choose the right CSS selector, knowledge that you'll find indispensible not only for creating style rules, but also for working with jQuery. The course takes you through the process of adapting for mobile phones and tablets a website that was originally designed for desktop computers. You�ll learn how to use CSS media queries to apply different styles depending on screen width, viewing the changes in real time in Dreamweaver�s Live view. The course concludes with an introduction to jQuery, and demonstrates how to enhance online forms with the help of Dreamweaver CS5.5�s built-in code hints for jQuery. This product includes over eight hours of exceptional quality video tutorials, with lesson files, assessment quizzes, and review materials. The video is wrapped in a unique interface that allows the viewer to jump to any topic and also bookmark individual sections for later review. The unique Watch-and-Work mode shrinks the video into a small window to allow the student to work alongside in Dreamweaver. Project files used in the lessons are included on the disc so viewers can practice what they've learned, and interactive review questions help reinforce freshly gained knowledge. Selected videos can be downloaded for viewing on iPhones, iPods, and other compatible mobile devices. The DVD-ROM is bundled with a printed booklet that provides supplemental material to enhance the video training.",

Style sheets describe how documents are presented on screens, in print, or even how they are pronounced when spoken using a computerized speech synthesizer. The specifications for Cascading Style Sheets Specification, Level 2, have been prepared by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), an independent and international standards body devoted to furthering the technologies used on the World Wide Web. The W3C has produced two recommendations (CSS1 and CSS2) which are widely, although not consistently, implemented in browsers, such as Microsoft Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator. The CSS2 specifications are an enhancement of the earlier CSS1 specifications, and provide greater control and flexibility in rendering a page on screen or paper. By attaching style sheets to documents on the Web authors and readers can influence the presentation of documents without sacrificing device-independence or adding new HTML tags. This book contains the complete and most up-to-date version currently available of the CSS2 specification.

If you've already got web design and development basics under your belt, but want to take your knowledge to the next level and unleash the full power of CSS in your web sites, then this is the book for you. It is a collection of proven CSS techniques that you can use daily to get the most out of the time you spend on your projects, from start to finish. Every topic is presented in an informative tutorial style, with each point backed up by several real-world examples and case studies. Authors Jeff Croft and Bryan Veloso cover all the essential areas of CSS development, like browser support (including IE7), hacks and filters, code management, advanced layouts and styling, typography, and much more. CSS levels 1, 2, and 3 are given a full treatment. The book also includes several reference sections that allow you to look up details quickly and easily. The book aims to help you in four areas: maintainability, compatibility, reusability, and practicality. You'll be able to keep your code organized and easy to maintain, avoiding browser issues before they crop up (or hacking around them when absolutely necessary). You'll learn to get the most out of your styles with inheritance, and by using techniques you can build on. And you'll learn to use what works in the real world, without getting too caught up in ideals, because you can always optimize later.",

It will give you a solid grounding on the theory, coding skills, and best practices needed to use HTML & CSS to build sophisticated web pages a complete reference for the beginner and intermediate user. Summary Brilliant HTML and CSS provides beginning Web designers and developers with the necessary theory, coding skills, and best practices to create clean, forward-looking, standards-compliant, accessible Web sites. The text reinforces the important distinction between structure and presentation and emphasizes the proper application of HTML tags and CSS properties from the opening chapter. Part I focuses on structural development, while Part II addresses presentation topics, and Part III offers advice about common design and navigation problems and the rationale behind their solutions. Upon finishing this book, a reader with no prior experience in Web design and development will be able to build sophisticated static pages. (An ideal companion to this book would be Brilliant JavaScript.) In keeping with the Brilliant series, the book uses a highly visual, task-based approach to achieve its objectives. Brilliant Features *Detailed index and troubleshooting guide to help you find exactly what you need to know *Each task is presented on one or two pages *Numbered steps guide you through each task or problem *Numerous screenshots illustrate each step * See Also boxes point you to related tasks and information in the book * Did you know ?...sections alert you to relevant expert tips, tricks and advice",

But print designers can't ignore the web and producing a design for the web has become a common part of a complete graphics package. And, knowing the basics of CSS is an essential ingredient for success. CSS for Print Designers presents web design concepts using metaphors that make sense to visual designers. Instead of using terms like semantics and structure, the book simplifies the language of web design using metaphors that print designers are comfortable with such as grouping like items or sculpting a layout from top to bottom or even how using sprites with CSS is like importing and cropping images in InDesign. The book uses efficient use of space with supporting graphics that demonstrate complex concepts such as nesting tags, clearing floats, and creating sprites.",

    "summary": "Tired of reading HTML books that only make sense after you're an expert? Then it's about time you picked up Head First HTML and really learned HTML. You want to learn HTML so you can finally create those web pages you've always wanted, so you can communicate more effectively with friends, family, fans, and fanatic customers. You also want to do it right so you can actually maintain and expand your web pages over time so they work in all browsers and mobile devices. Oh, and if you've never heard of CSS, that's okay--we won't tell anyone you're still partying like it's 1999--but if you're going to create web pages in the 21st century then you'll want to know and understand CSS. Learn the real secrets of creating web pages, and why everything your boss told you about HTML tables is probably wrong (and what to do instead). Most importantly, hold your own with your co-worker (and impress cocktail party guests) when he casually mentions how his HTML is now strict, and his CSS is in an external style sheet. With Head First HTML, you'll avoid the embarrassment of thinking web-safe colors still matter, and the foolishness of slipping a font tag into your pages. Best of all, you'll learn HTML and CSS in a way that won't put you to sleep. If you've read a Head First book, you know what to expect: a visually-rich format designed for the way your brain works. Using the latest research in neurobiology, cognitive science, and learning theory, this book will load HTML and CSS into your brain in a way that sticks. So what are you waiting for? Leave those other dusty books behind and come join us in Webville. Your tour is about to begin.",

    "summary": "It�s widely predicted that mobile phones and tablets will overtake desktop PCs as the most common Web access devices within the next two or three years. Adobe is responding to this dramatic shift by focusing on new tools to develop websites for multiple platforms with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in Dreamweaver CS5.5. In particular, Dreamweaver engineers have been working closely with the developers of jQuery, the de-facto standard JavaScript framework, to develop jQuery Mobile. This is a new JavaScript/CSS framework designed to create websites and applications that work consistently in all major mobile platforms, including iPhone, Android, BlackBerry, and Symbian (Nokia). This book explores in depth the integration of jQuery Mobile in Dreamweaver, together with other new features aimed at building websites that work across multiple devices. Using a series of practical examples, the book will show how to optimize an existing website for display in desktops, tablets, and mobile phones, using CSS media queries. Readers will also learn how to create a dedicated mobile site using jQuery Mobile. Although Dreamweaver will generate much of the necessary code automatically, the book will explain the structure of jQuery Mobile websites and web applications, so that developers can go beyond the basics to add custom functionality and design features. The book will also utilize the core jQuery framework, demonstrating how the new jQuery code hinting in Dreamweaver CS5.5 speeds up the development process for experienced developers and acts as a learning aid for those new to jQuery. Readers will learn how to convert a jQuery Mobile web application into a native app (that can be loaded on an iPhone or Android device) using PhoneGap, another open source framework.",

It's not going to show Web designers everything there is to know about CSS but rather will provide a solid introduction from which to build their CSS knowledge. The beginning of the book starts with the basics -- rules, selectors, classes, IDs, the cascade, internal and external style sheets, Divs, boxes, floats, padding, margins -- everything is covered. Next comes styling elements, working with images, menus and navigation, and moving styles from internal to external style sheets. Rounding out this project-based guide is working with browsers, both old and new, and debugging CSS. Succinct and to the point, it's the perfect book for designers without a lot of time who need to understand and start using CSS.",

In HTML & CSS: The Good Parts, author Ben Henick removes the junk code, the bolted-on parts, and all those ideas that once made sense to reveal a core set of reliable components that will spare you hours of battling browsers and adjusting page layouts. This book covers all aspects of web page design, from typography and color to layout, to help you: Learn which pieces of HTML and CSS deserve focus, and which can be abandoned Discover how the two technologies tightly mesh Understand how the Web 2.0 era has changed the way we use HTML and CSS Set priorities and choose components that will work reliably across sites and browsers Recognize the bad and downright awful parts of HTML and CSS, along with the good, to understand why warning labels are sometimes necessary Whether you handcraft individual pages or build templates, HTML & CSS: the Good Parts will help you get the most out of HTML and CSS without being trapped by junk code."

    "summary": "Tired of reading HTML books that only make sense after you're an expert? Then it's about time you picked up \"Head First HTML with CSS & XHTML and really learned HTML. You want to learn HTML so you can finally create those Web pages you've always wanted, so you can communicate more effectively with friends, family, fans and fanatic customers. You also want to do it right so you can actually maintain and expand your Web pages over time, and so your Web pages work in all the browsers and mobile devices out there. Oh, and if you've never heard of CSS, that's okay - we won't tell anyone you're still partying like it's 1999 - but if you're going to create Web pages in the 21st century then you'll want to know and understand CSS. Learn the real secrets of creating Web pages, and why everything your boss told you about HTML tables is probably wrong (and what to do instead). Most importantly, hold your own with your co-worker (and impress cocktail party guests) when he casually mentions how his HTML is now strict, and his CSS is in an external style sheet. With \"Head First HTML with CSS & XHTML, you'll avoid the embarrassment of thinking Web-safe colors still matter, and the foolishness of slipping a font tag into your pages. Best of all, you'll learn HTML and CSS in a way that won't put you to sleep. If you've read a Head First book, you know what to expect: a visually-rich format designed for the way your brain works. Using the latest research in neurobiology, cognitive science, and learning theory, this book will load HTML, CSS, and XHTML into your brain in a way that sticks. So what are you waiting for? Leave those other dusty books behind and come join us in Webville.Your tour is about to begin. \"Elegant design is at the core of every chapter here, each concept conveyed with equal doses of pragmatism and wit.\" --Ken Goldstein, Executive Vice President, Disney Online \"This book is a thoroughly modern introduction to forward-looking practices in web page markup and presentation.\" --Danny Goodman, author of \"Dynamic HTML: The Definitive Guide \"What used to be a long trial and error learning process has now been reduced neatly into an engaging paperback.\" --Mike Davidson, CEO, Newsvine, Inc. \"I love \"Head First HTML with CSS & XHTML--it teaches you everything you need to learn in a 'fun coated' format!\" --Sally Applin, UI Designer and Artist \"I haven't had as much fun reading a book (other than Harry Potter) in years. And your book finally helped me break out of my hapless so-last-century way of creating web pages.\" --Professor David M. Arnow, Department of Computer and Information Science, Brooklyn College \"If you've ever had a family member who wanted you to design a website for them, buy them Head First HTML with CSS and XHTML. If you've ever asked a family member to design you a web site, buy this book. If you've ever bought an HTML book and ended up using it to level your desk, or for kindling on a cold winter day, buy this book. This is the book you've been waiting for. This is the learning system you've been waiting for.\" --Warren Kelly, Blogcritics.org",

    "summary": "\"As the Web evolves to incorporate new standards and the latest browsers offer new possibilities for creative design, the art of creating Web sites is also changing. Few Web designers are experienced programmers, and as a result, working with semantic markup and CSS can create roadblocks to achieving truly beautiful designs using all the resources available. Add to this the pressures of presenting exceptional design to clients and employers, without compromising efficient workflow, and the challenge deepens for those working in a fast-paced environment. As someone who understands these complexities firsthand, author and designer Andy Clarke offers visual designers a progressive approach to creating artistic, usable, and accessible sites using transcendent CSS.\" \"In this groundbreaking book, you'll discover how to implement highly original designs through visual demonstrations of the creative possibilities using markup and CSS. You'll learn to use a new design workflow, build prototypes that work well for designers and all team members, use grids effectively, visualize markup, and discover every phase of the transcendent design process, from working with the latest browsers to incorporating CSS3 to collaborating with team members effectively, and much more.\"--BOOK JACKET.",

They improve productivity, creativity, and efficiency in web design and development, and they reduce code bloat and complexity. In the context of CSS and HTML, design patterns are sets of common functionality that work across various browsers and screen readers, without sacrificing design values or accessibility or relying on hacks and filters. But until now they have not been applied systematically to HTML and CSS web design and development. With the help of Pro CSS and HTML Design Patterns, you can reap the benefits of using design patterns in your HTML and CSS code. The book provides you with all the CSS and HTML design patterns you need. Web development expert and author Michael Bowers then takes you through multiple design patterns for text, backgrounds, borders, images, forms, layouts, and much more. He shows you exactly how each one works, and how to use them most effectively in your own projects. After you learn about these design patterns, you'll wonder how you ever developed web sites without them!",

    "summary": "This is a different kind of CSS book. It takes the approach that there's a real connection between craftsmanship and Web design. Handcrafted CSS gives frustrated Web designers the ammo they need to convince their clients and bosses to adopt innovative and effective CSS techniques that make their lives easier while improving the end user's experience. This book offers designers a transitional approach that teaches them when it's OK to push the envelope a bit, how best to do it, and when not to.The book's seven chapters deconstruct various aspects of a case-study Web site, focusing on aspects that make it bulletproof and demonstrate progressive enrichment techniques over more traditional labor-intensive methods. Subjects include building for unanticipated future use; progressively enriching designs using CSS3 properties that work today; the magic and flexibility of using RGB color with an alpha channel; modular float management, crafting flexible frameworks; fluid layouts using grid-based design principles; and craftsmanship details on typography, jQuery, and shifting backgrounds.",

    "summary": "By the time of American Civil War things had changed from the Age of Fighting Sail - steam power and explosive shells were transforming naval warfare. Iron was beginning to supplant wood. Britain had just finished HMS Warrior, an iron-hulled warship and coastal ironclads dominated the waters off the United States. The changes meant that ships sank, during battles instead of afterwards. The fights were no less bloody, but in addition to flying splinters, a host of other dangers were added - burst steam boilers, fire due to exploding shells, and the burst from the shells themselves. But, just as in the age of sail, warship captains that won one-on-one battles with another warship became as famous as modern sports stars. During the course of the American Civil War, three single ship actions were fought between Union cruisers and Confederate raiders: CSS Florida vs. USS Wachusett, CSS Alabama vs. USS Hatteras, and CSS Alabama vs. USS Kearsarge. This book will present those, with an emphasis on the most famous battle: Alabama's fight with Kearsarge. Next to the battle between USS Monitor and CSS Virginia, no other naval duel of the American Civil War drew as much interest. That story is told from the eyes of the participants filtered through the lens of historical analysis available since the battles were fought. This includes archeological studies of wrecks of some of these ships, making this book an indispensible guide for anyone interested in Civil War and naval history.",

    "summary": "When the CSS Virginia (Merrimack) slowly steamed down the Elizabeth River toward Hampton Roads on March 8, 1862, the tide of naval warfare turned from wooden sailing ships to armored, steam-powered vessels. Little did the ironclad's crew realize that their makeshift warship would achieve the greatest Confederate naval victory. The trip was thought by most of the crew to be a trial cruise. Instead, the Virginia's aggressive commander, Franklin Buchanan, transformed the voyage into a test by fire that forever proved the supreme power of iron over wood. The Virginia's ability to beat the odds to become the first ironclad to enter Hampton Roads stands as a testament to her designers, builders, officers and crew. Virtually everything about the Virginia s design was an improvisation or an adaptation, characteristic of the Confederacy's efforts to wage a modern war with limited industrial resources. Noted historian John V. Quarstein recounts the compelling story of this ironclad underdog, providing detailed appendices, including crew member biographies and a complete chronology of the ship and crew.",

Smith has captured 100 original tips and tricks for using CSS in new and unusual ways. These include hacks for using CSS in place of JavaScript for creating dropdown menus and image rollovers, adding rounded box corners, anchoring elements so they don't move when scrolling, displaying text backward to give the browser a mirror, highlighting required fields on a form, and changing the mouse pointer to alert viewers to the nature of an element.

    "summary": "This book covers the entire process of building a website. This process involves much more than just technical knowledge, and this book provides you with all the information you'll need to understand the concepts behind designing and developing for the Web, as well as the best means to deliver professional, best-practice-based results. There is far more to building a successful website than knowing a little Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). The process starts long before any coding takes place, and this book introduces you to the agile development process, explaining why this method makes so much sense for web projects and how best to implement it. Planning is vital, so you'll also learn how to use techniques such as brainstorming, wireframes, mockups, and prototypes to get your project off to the best possible start and help ensure smooth progress as it develops. An understanding of correct, semantic markup is essential to any web professional, so this book explains how XHTML should be used to structure content so that the markup adheres to current web standards. You'll learn about the wide range of HTML elements available to you, and you'll learn how and when to use them through building example web pages. Without creative use of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), websites would all look largely the same. CSS gives you the ability to set your website apart from the rest while maintaining the integrity of your markup. You'll learn how CSS works and how to apply styles to your pages, enabling you to realize your design ideas in the browser. JavaScript can be used to make your website easier and more interesting to use. This book provides information on appropriate uses of this technology and introduces the concepts of programming using it. You'll also see how JavaScript works as part of the much-hyped technique Ajax and in turn where Ajax fits into the wider Web 2.0 picture. While a website is being built, it needs to be tested across multiple browsers and platforms to ensure that the site works for all users, regardless of ability or disability, and the book explains how best to do these tasks. Then, it discusses the process of launching and maintaining the site so that it will continue to work for all its users throughout its life-cycle. The book concludes by covering server-side technologies, acting as a guide to the different options available and explaining differences between available products. With insights from renowned experts such as Jason Fried of 37signals, Daniel Burka of Digg and Pownce, and Chris Messina of Citizen Agency, Foundation Website Creation provides invaluable information applicable to every web project, regardless of size, scope, or budget. In this book you'll See how the Web has developed and the role web standards play Learn how to plan and manage the building of a website Learn how to separate content from presentation with HTML and CSS See how JavaScript can be used to enhance your website Learn how best to test, launch, and maintain a website Summary of Contents Chapter 1 Introducing the Past, Present, and Future of the Web Chapter 2 Keeping a Project on Track Chapter 3 Planning and High-Level Design Chapter 4 Writing Markup with HTML and XHTML Chapter 5 Exploring Fundamental Concepts of CSS Chapter 6 Developing CSS in Practice: From Design to Deployment Chapter 7 Creating Interactivity with JavaScript Chapter 8 Testing, Launching, and Maintaining Chapter 9 Web 2.0: Using Ajax and Social Software Chapter 10 Using Server-Side Technologies Afterword The Business of the Web",

Jason takes an approach to CSS that breaks it down around common design tasks and helps the reader learn that they already think in styles--they just need to learn to speak the language.Jason helps Web designers find their voice, walks them through the grammar of CSS, shows them how to write their design specs in CSS, and how to prepare it for screen, printer or handheld devices. Along the way designers will learn to optimize their code, make it accessible, optimize for search engines, mix it up with Flash, and more.",

To watch the videos, choose the lesson you want to start with from the list of lessons on the left side of the window, and then click the Play button in the player window on the right side. How to Use the Learning Labs and Take the Quizzes After each video is complete, you can optionally work through the Learning Lab exercises and take a short (not too hard) quiz to help assess what you�ve learned in that lesson. The Learning Lab exercises in this course require you to create and save HTML and CSS files using a text or web page editor, which you can then view off your computer hard disk in a web browser. The quizzes after the exercises are relatively short and painless. After you make your choice, the program will tell you immediately if you�re correct or wrong. Your answers are not stored or compiled, so you can take the quizzes as often as you like, and guessing won�t count against you. Setting Up Your Learning Environment The accompanying DVD contains a complete software toolkit with everything you�ll need to complete the course�s examples. You can install this software by clicking the Install Software and Support link on the opening screen of the DVD�s main interface, or by navigating to the DVD in your computer�s file browser and running the file named Software (Software.exe in Windows or Software.app in Mac OS X). Sams Teach Yourself HTML and CSS Video Learning is organized into four parts. Each part has six lessons, and each lesson is designed to be completed in 10 minutes or less.

The Essential Guide to Dreamweaver CS4 with CSS, Ajax, and PHP concentrates on getting the best out of Dreamweaver CS4, rather than going into every menu item and toolbar icon. The emphasis is on developing websites compliant with the latest web standards, using CSS, JavaScript libraries (with particular emphasis on Spry, Adobe's implementation of Ajax), and PHP. The book covers all aspects of the new user interface, including workspace layouts, iconic panels, the related documents feature, Live View, Code Navigator, and Live Code. It also shows how to use the improved CSS editing features, and JavaScript code introspection. There is also coverage of other new features, such as version control through Subversion integration, and the improved support for Photoshop integration through the use of Smart Objects. What you'll learn Streamline your workflow with the Related Files toolbar, Live view, and the Code Navigator Bring your pages alive with Ajax widgets from Spry, jQuery, and the Yahoo! User Interface Library Use server-side includes, templates, and Adobe's InContext Editing online service Create dynamic web applications using Dreamweaver's PHP server behaviors Build real world web site functions, such as form validation, random quote generator, search function, user management/login pages, dynamic Ajax gallery, and much more Consume RSS feeds and create Spry data sets How to publish your site after you've created it",

He'll do anything for him-including bury his feelings for a man he met while he and Spencer were separated last year. Justin never planned to fall in love, and he certainly never planned to tell Spencer about it-but when a phone call wakes them in the middle of the night to inform Justin that his former lover, Dutch Keller, has been in an accident, he doesn't have a choice. Justin's revelation shatters the fragile relationship he and Spencer were trying to rebuild. The weight of his guilt-both for hurting Spencer and for leaving a heartbroken Dutch to find solace in a bottle-crushes him. But what Justin doesn't know is that Spencer and Dutch guard an explosive secret of their own. All three men are tangled in a communal web of lies, and unless they find the events in their lives that ultimately led them to friendship, passion, and betrayal, they won't see the love at the heart of the pain.",

These were the tools of prosperity in a competitive college town of ruthless stratification, or so Darren Bryce was taught by his experiences within the mainstream social scene of Tallahassee. In FRATIRE III, Bryce has risen to the next level of the social status pyramid but is still struggling to climb even higher in his pursuit of lust and power as he walks the fine grey line between having a girlfriend and being single. And the closer Bryce gets to the inner circle of popularity, the more he comes to realize that a social world revolving so much around beauty is truly an ugly place indeed. Bryce exposes it all: Greek Life, clubbing, hazing, one-night stands, Rush Week, strip clubs, date functions, Frat house bashes, keg party brawls, and the lewdest of drunken humor. This is the uncensored story of what really happens in the wildest of college towns.",
