# Timers

Managed JavaScript timers to minimize the number of intervals used and maximize timer configuration and control.  A suitable replacement for Unix cron in a Node.js process.

## Usage
Timers live inside timer folders or may be created programmatically.  A timer includes a function and an interval, as with using native **setInterval**.  What's different is that timers may be paused, timers may be analyzed (e.g. number of executions), and timers are modifiable (e.g. change interval).

### Timed Generators

A subclass exists for timed iterators.  While JavaScript generators offer function-scoped state to control iteration, Timed Generators allow tasks to be scheduled in a stack.  When the timer function is called, the next item in the stack is executed.  If no items exist in the stack when the timer function is called, then nothing is executed.
