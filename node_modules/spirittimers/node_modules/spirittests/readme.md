## Duplicate Functionality
Provides duplicate functionality of Jasmine's default behavior to collect ``spec/**/*.[sS]pec.js``  and ``spec/helpers/**/*.js``.  Modifies default collection behavior to obtain all .js files from the tests subdirectory, i.e. ``tests/**/*.js``.

## Additional Functionality
Module also configures on-demand tests within Jasmine, resolving a promise when tests pass, rejecting a promise when tests fail.

## Planned Functionality
Module also shall provide an indication if depenndencies are out of date.  Module shall also run tests for dependencies on-demand. 

## Unplanned Functionlity

Performance testing.
