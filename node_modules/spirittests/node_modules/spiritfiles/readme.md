# Files

Recursive filename retrieval using the node_modules filesystem.  Files are delivered first from node_modules, then from the executing module.

## Usage

Use ``require('spiritfiles').readFiles(fromFolder);`` to retrieve an array listing of files from the executing directory and the node_modules diretory.

### On Update

You can listen for filesystem updates by adding a callback function to **readFiles**.  When new files are added to **fromFolder**, the callback will be called with the **newFiles** as the first argument, e.g.:

```
require('spiritfiles').readFiles(fromFolder, (newFiles) => {
}, updateInterval);
```

### Advanced Usage

Advanced usage includes segmenting file reads between node_modules and the executing directory.  Also, a user may switch the RScandir sort strategy from DEPTH_FIRST to ALPHABETICAL.  Please contact the author for more support.
